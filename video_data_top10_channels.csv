37,-izKr8EoC-s,Frizz,Its time to fight some demons (and talk about Pathfinder),"Welcome back folks! Today we're playing through a version of Wrath of the Righteous that has been lightly modded! I've already done a playthrough on my own, but I want to see other parts of the game, and I'd like to share it with all of you. This is the 3rd stream, but it doesn't matter all that much if you haven't seen the last couple! Lets hang out and talk about some Pathfinder, both First AND Second Edition!

Modlist:
REQUIRED BY LAW
Toybox (a bag of tricks) (Tons of cheats and quality of life options. This game is buggy as hell sometimes, and Toybox helps so, so much. Like if you dimension door your party, but accidentally leave someone on a roof and now you've softlocked the game since you don't have another dimension door :) Now you can teleport the party to you! Install this!)
Modfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (A launcher that lets you browse and install mods easily)

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Auto Mount (Do you WANT to mount up manually 100+ times?)
Bubble Buffs (allows for autobuffing. It WILL save you hours)
Bubble Tweaks (Quality of life tweaks)
Mod Menu (Some mod settings in game)
More Bulk Sell (screw inventory management!)
Multiple Archetypes (Its a tabletop rule!)
Mythic Spellbook Tweaks (Maybe you want to change some!)
Respec Mod (Fix horrible build decisions in your companions!)
Scaling Cantrips (God cantrips normally are horrible)
Tabletop Tweaks Base (Tabletop Rules)
Tabletop Tweaks Core (Used by other mods)
Tabletop Tweaks Mythic Rework (Rebalances mythic options that desperately need it. Mostly buffing options so they are actually cool.)
Weapon Focus Plus (Expands feats that effect specific weapons to effect the entire weapon group, so you can actually use the cool loot you find)

THE REST OF THE MODS
Buy Material Components (Automatically buy expensive material components and cooking ingredients at a configurable price. I've got it set to buying at double price. I don't want to have to micromanage my inventory!)
Character Options+ (Some fun tabletop character options)
Combat Relief (Updated) (Allows you to skip random encounters and crusade battles. Random encounters can get VERY OLD VERY FAST)
Dark Codex (Lots of new feats and abilities, with some great options for kineticists. I'm using it to give basic feats to all party members because screw having to take weapon finesse and power attack!)
Expanded Content (Wow, even more stuff from the tabletop version of the game! Can you see a theme with my mods????)
Finnean Tweaks (Helps a fun weapon stay relevant as you progress through the game)
Homebrew Archetypes (Archetypes from tabletop)
Levelable Aivu (Makes the Azata mythic path busted as all hell if you want that)
Microscopic Content Expansion (Some feats)
Morvarch's Playstyle Expansions (New options for specific types of characters. Might be buggy?)
Toggleable Throwing Weapons (Did you know you can throw daggers?)

45,qbHw_UJGNoA,Frizz,Lets start to wrap of Act 2 of Wrath of the Righteous!,"Welcome back folks! Today we're playing through a version of Wrath of the Righteous that has been lightly modded! I've already done a playthrough on my own, but I want to see other parts of the game, and I'd like to share it with all of you. This is the 3rd stream, but it doesn't matter all that much if you haven't seen the last couple! Lets hang out and talk about some Pathfinder, both First AND Second Edition!

Modlist:
REQUIRED BY LAW
Toybox (a bag of tricks) (Tons of cheats and quality of life options. This game is buggy as hell sometimes, and Toybox helps so, so much. Like if you dimension door your party, but accidentally leave someone on a roof and now you've softlocked the game since you don't have another dimension door :) Now you can teleport the party to you! Install this!)
Modfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (A launcher that lets you browse and install mods easily)

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Auto Mount (Do you WANT to mount up manually 100+ times?)
Bubble Buffs (allows for autobuffing. It WILL save you hours)
Bubble Tweaks (Quality of life tweaks)
Mod Menu (Some mod settings in game)
More Bulk Sell (screw inventory management!)
Multiple Archetypes (Its a tabletop rule!)
Mythic Spellbook Tweaks (Maybe you want to change some!)
Respec Mod (Fix horrible build decisions in your companions!)
Scaling Cantrips (God cantrips normally are horrible)
Tabletop Tweaks Base (Tabletop Rules)
Tabletop Tweaks Core (Used by other mods)
Tabletop Tweaks Mythic Rework (Rebalances mythic options that desperately need it. Mostly buffing options so they are actually cool.)
Weapon Focus Plus (Expands feats that effect specific weapons to effect the entire weapon group, so you can actually use the cool loot you find)

THE REST OF THE MODS
Buy Material Components (Automatically buy expensive material components and cooking ingredients at a configurable price. I've got it set to buying at double price. I don't want to have to micromanage my inventory!)
Character Options+ (Some fun tabletop character options)
Combat Relief (Updated) (Allows you to skip random encounters and crusade battles. Random encounters can get VERY OLD VERY FAST)

It's become the societal norm, when talking about Tabletop RPGs, to simply say ""It's basically Dungeons and Dragons, but different"". This does a great disservice to the people who work hard on creating unique and independant system with zero connection to D&D. 

Games like Pathfinder 2e, Call of Cthulhu, Shadowrun, and more all work hard to make their own games with their own rules to tell their own stories, but they're constantly compared to D&D simply because it's the most popular. It'd be great if we could stop doing this, but is it too late?

834,kxc1zmnVo5w,Nonat1s,11 UNBELIEVABLE DICE-HACKS THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE,"Dice Organization and cleaning hacks that will make you more productive

A clean and organized set of dice makes you feel motivated and productive. But we all get tired thinking about our old, dusty dice. To inspire you, I’m sharing some fun DIY cleaning hacks and ideas that will make your dice shine.
If your dice are covered with dirt, crumbs, and other stuff that shouldn’t be there, I show you a fun way to clean it using a microwave. 
Not everyone is an expert in holding their dice right. If you’re clumsy like me, you can avoid dropping your dice using a soda bottle. 
Watch the entire video to discover all the DIY ideas and dice hacks that will make your RPG routine more manageable.

Thanks again to NoNat for coming on the show again.  Kid you not, I haven't ever laughed as hard recording an episode as I did in this episode.  There were parts I had to cut because we just went on laughing too hard for too long.  If you're up in the air about whether or not to get Sinclair's Library, honestly, it is a worthwhile investment, especially if you're the kind of person who likes having flavorful NPCs and a rich world. Don't try to reinvent the wheel, get this and use it as a basis for your own content.  If you're reading this far, man you must be a really cool human being.

Fun fact- this was actually the first Oa6 episode we recorded, but we could tell we were a bit all-over-the-place for a first episode, so this got pushed to episode 2.  You can tell that we all really got into this one, because we had some opinions.  This might be a hot topic, and we might've had some hot takes, so tell us in the comments what you thought, leave a review, or just say hello.

In this episode, we discuss some alternative approaches we take to the game of Pathfinder 2e, which we feel deserves some attention, as well as air our grievances about some of the way aspects of PF2 are perceived/discussed within the community.

It's been enjoyable compiling these videos together. I used a track that's been stuck in my head all day for the bumpers.  You might recognize the voice as belonging to one Michael Cara. I'm not sure how well it works, but I think art is about making something and just seeing how things play out sometimes. It's nice to tie my videos to my own life (though the bulk of the content is entirely made by Visit Golarin's Tit Tok account, which you should go sub to).  

It was raining all day today. ""I don't need an umbrella"" I said to myself while a light mist covered New York City and I went out for lunch.  Cut to an hour later and I'm walking back into my building drenched to the bone. Sitting next to my space heater trying to dry myself out now.  These are thing kind of things I live for, haha. I hope your day is going well too.

While we're talking about gods, this may be a good time to introduce a god to you all that we here at deadly d8 have come to know and worship: Groetus.  He's not included in this video, because all current depictions of Groetus have been built on a foundation of lies that are not to be trusted.  That's all I can say for now about that, but thanks for taking the time to stop by- make sure to leave a comment/like if you're reading this- youtube eats that stuff up, and it does wonders for our channel's metrics.

Oh-boy, the path to getting the required 4,000 watch hours in order to become an official channel has been a long and arduous one.  People who make long-form content and find mild success usually don't have any trouble getting there, but since we make content for squirrel brains, it's been a real challenge.  You have to get the time watched within a one year period. And we hit that recently, can you believe it?  But we only made about 1/2 the time required. So now every day, we're battling against getting more watch time and losing the watch time we already had.  So if you, for some weird reason are still watching this, know that your viewership is appreciated. And hey, if you opened a longer video of ours and just let it play in the background, I'd be sure to keep that secret between you and us.  Thanks for supporting us. Thanks for reading these secret blog entries.  This form of art is fulfilling but it also takes a lot out of you. That said, I'm so thrilled about where we are today. We couldn't be here without you.

Solar Power,
- Macarthur

923,MPyB0VXTjg0,deadly d8,Gods of Golarion #1  [Tiktok Vaults],"This is an upload of older Tiktok Videos compiled (with permission) from the Visit Golarion TikTok Account.  Please mind any weird audio or video issues- Tiktok likes making things difficult.

Tiktok's algorithms are really scary. If you haven't tried the app out yet, let me tell you, it will figure out your exact interests in a short period of time. It definitely takes a few days, while it narrows down your feed, but after a bit, it figures out exactly what you want and beams a non-stop stream of that to your phone.  I recommend trying it out in moderation.  It's cool but eerie. 

If you or anyone you know might be interested in making Pathfinder oriented content for Tiktok, there's quite literally never been a better time. Help spread the word while flexing your creative muscles.  I know there's some resistance to trying the app out, but this app is an inevitability just like youtube was when it first started out.   

Am I suggesting we build Roko's Basilisk together? Uhhh... pass?  Why are you still reading this? You probably have better things to do.   But if you have made it this far, you should definitely like the video and leave a comment. Youtube's algorithms love that stuff, and it helps push our channel to a broader audience.  

Keep it real,
- Macarthur

If you scrolled down to read this, you're a big old nerd, and my kind of people.  You can use Golem Grafter to get to 430 HP, but since it was AP specific and less funny, we chose not to include it. I believe you can also get to 420 with Dwarf/Mountain's Stoutness, though it takes longer.

**** This is an updated version of a previously released video.  This version includes information from the October 2020 errata; specifically that spells may be sustained multiple times in the same round to trigger their effects multiple times, except for those that specifically note otherwise.  The errata also adjusts the description of several spells (including Flaming Sphere) so that they may only benefit from being sustained once per round.

In this video we examine the process for determining when a character dies, with attention paid to the Wounded and Dying conditions.  Part 2 will expand on this process by covering other conditions, feats and situations that apply to death in the game.
 
*** THIS IS AN UPDATED VERSION OF A PREVIOUSLY RELEASED VIDEO.  The only difference is this version uses the language from the errata that says when you are reduced to zero hit points your place in initiative is moved to immediately before the current turn... and not immediately before the turn of the creature or effect that reduced you to zero hit points.  This is an important distinction for when you are reduced to zero HP on your turn due to an enemy's Attack of Opportunity.

1225,NwQPa26oHYE,How It's Played,Pathfinder (2e): Diplomacy & Intimidation,"The basics of influence in the Pathfinder 2nd Edition RPG from Paizo.

*This is an updated version of a previously published video.  The original version is accurate, but I corrected one off-the-cuff remark about what happens when you critically fail an attempt to Request.  The previous version implied that a critical fail could lower the target's attitude to Hostile if they were already Unfriendly, but since you have to be at least Friendly to attempt Request, that couldn't happen. 

In this video we examine how players may influence other characters.  We discuss the attitude conditions (Helpful, Friendly, Indifferent, Unfriendly, and Hostile), as well as skill actions that can be used to alter an NPC's attitude (Make an Impression, Request, Coerce, Demoralize and Lie).

***This is an updated version of a previously published video.  Although the original version is factually correct, I added some clarifying information in regards to negative effects ending when a player declares they are delaying.  This is a very, very minor change from the original release.

In this video we examine two key ways in which a player may adjust when they act within the initiative order.  If you haven't already viewed it, it is recommended you watch our video in Initiative before viewing this one.

1227,p10Lh9vvQYY,How It's Played,"Pathfinder Cutting Room Floor: Initiative, Surprise and Perception","Hello!  I have something a little different for everyone today.  When I originally recorded the Pathfinder Basics of Initiative and Surprise video it included 5 full examples.  However, after creating all 5 examples, I decided that the 5th example wasn't really about initiative or surprise and was really about perception.  So, I decided to delete it.

But I figure someone, somewhere might find that deleted example useful, so I'm including it here for anyone who is interested.

In the first part of this series we provided an overview of how starships function.  We introduced a few key terms, reviewed important ways in which starship combat differs from personal combat, and completely dissected a typical starship's stat block.  While doing so we briefly touched on concepts like damage thresholds, when critical damage is inflicted, and how shields function.

In Part 2 of the series we pick up where we left off and examine the Roles players will assume while aboard a starship.  After that, we move onto discussing the way combat is structured.  As with personal-scale combat, Starship Combat plays out in a series of rounds.  However, there is a major difference from personal combat in that these rounds are divided into distinct ""Phases"", and each phase dictates when a character may take their action (based on their assigned Role).

When this series continues we will begin in-depth reviews of each of the five Roles and their corresponding systems -- starting with Sensors and Science Officers.

1252,QtiF3WstjGY,How It's Played,Starfinder Basics of Starships Part 01: An Overview,"The basics of Starships in the Starfinder RPG from Paizo!

This is the first part of what will be a fairly lengthy series focused on Starships and Starship Combat in the Starfinder RPG.

Starship combat is one of the most complex aspects of the Starfinder ruleset, and is often looked at as its own sort of mini-game nestled within a Starfinder adventure.  As such, there is way too much content to try and tackle in one video, but our goal is to give all the players and GMs out there the info they need to be successful by the end of the series.

This first part is an overview of how starships function.  We go over a few key terms, review important ways in which starship combat differs from personal combat, and completely dissect a typical starship's stat block.  While doing so we briefly touch on concepts like damage thresholds, when critical damage is inflicted, and how shields function.  Everything discussed in this video will be examined in full detail in the later parts of this series.

In Part 2 of this series we will discuss how starship combat is divided into distinct ""Phases"" that dictate when a player can act and what they can do on their turn.  We will also introduce the concept of Roles and how crewmembers (and players) select a specific duty, independent of their character class, while aboard a starship.

In our previous video we discussed the actions a player can declare when it is their turn.  And in part 3 of our Basics of Combat series we explore what a player can do when it is *not* their turn -- take Reactions.  We will also be examining a number of ""Optional Actions"" from the Dungeon Master's Guide.  These are not standard, universal rules, but are some options each DM may decide to include in their games.  The Optional Actions we discuss in this video include Climb onto a Bigger Creature, Overrun, and Tumble.

In Part 4 of this series we will review the Attack Action and all the options available when a character is on the offensive.

1260,OwkOT3lSAzs,How It's Played,Starfinder: Basics of Hacking,"The basics of Hacking and computer security in the Starfinder RPG from Paizo!  How hacking works, when it's needed, the consequences of doing so, and more are covered in this video.

But before we get into all of that, I want to first give a big thanks to the official Starfinder Forum community and the r/Starfinder_RPG subreddit for their assistance making this video.  To put things simply, the Hacking Rules in Starfinder are a mess.  They are full of inconsistencies, contradictions, and unusual wording.  

You're probably already aware of that and are watching this video to *finally* learn how Paizo expects Hacking to work.  And I have bad news for you... even after all the research for this video I'm still not 100% sure how Paizo expects Hacking to work.  All I do know is if you ask three different experts how something should play out (and I have), you'll get three different answers, all with rules to back up their position.

The only thing I am confident of is Paizo expects each individual GM to make the call for when a countermeasure is triggered, or if a hacker faces a Fake Shell after a roll, or if having credentials grants access or still calls for a Computers Check, or if an additional roll is needed to disable a Secure Data Module behind a Firewall, etc.

Ultimately, this video is how I manage the Hacking Rules in my game, and is based on plentiful research, discussions with many GMs, and my own interpretation of what the rules represent and make sense.  But as a disclaimer, I cannot guarantee every second of this video is accurate to Paizo's intent with Hacking.  If there is an official update to these rules, I will update these notes accordingly and may produce a new version of this video if called for.

In this edition we discuss:
- Does Harrying Fire work with Gunnery Checks?
- Can a starship captain's Encourage ability be used to apply a bonus to Gunnery Checks?
- How the heck do Solarian Powers work?!
- Can Sentient Robot Organisms use telepathy or dream of electric skittermanders?

1267,oj7CdFetEro,How It's Played,Starfinder: Basics of Cover,"The basics of cover in the Starfinder RPG from Paizo!

This one might be slightly controversial, so let me address the ""elephant in the room"".  This overview of cover does not discuss what happens when a target line runs the length of a wall.  This is a condition that only appears in the description of a picture in the Core Rules, not in the text explanation of cover, and there is a lot to support the belief that it is an editing error... not the least of which being the official wiki does not mention it at all.

So in an attempt to avoid confusion, I have omitted it as well.  However, in the name of being complete, I may discuss this situation in an upcoming supplemental video.

1269,1wk9R31MBGg,The Rules Lawyer,I react to and rebut the 3 Puffin Forest and Taking20 videos quitting Pathfinder 2e (Rules Lawyer),"Join me LIVE in chat I give them the patented Rules Lawyer analytical eye! (Note: I have seen these videos before and so I will be prepared... this is meant to be a tool for people checking out the system!)

This is the 4th in my ""Pathfinder Law School"" series to give migrants to PF2E an overview of the system and help people in learning and enjoying it!

""Pathfinder Law School"" playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5LfnOlAZRY6xyzxnx7JwV4hq9f8z7Y_V

WHY AM I REACTING TO THESE OLD VIDEOS?:
These 3 videos and their creators are still Top Results when people browse YouTube for Pathfinder 2e reviews, and have convinced many people not to play the system.

Michael Sayre, Paizo Design Manager, referenced ""dunk videos"" as one of the ""challenges"" faced by Paizo that has discouraged people from trying PF2E: https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/xsgynk/its_impossible_to_say_how_important_this/ 

And there was a Reddit thread Jan. 15, 2023, while the Wizards of the Coast's OGL scandal was its height, of people saying they were ""misled"" from checking out PF2E by these 3 videos:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/10csgyb/taking_20_puffin_forest_5e_migrants_misled/

I repeatedly refer on-stream to my rebuttal video to Taking20's combat example. Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xV7BOFwyw

My 1st 'rebuttal' to Puffin Forest: https://youtube.com/shorts/pYg_ArOjfZM?feature=share

EDIT: Here's the video response I wanted to share on stream but couldn't find! It's an effective rebuttal to Taking20's combat: https://youtu.be/nTsFZ-GbxMM

https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/132dddd/pathfinder_2e_remaster_megathread/

So people know what people normally refer to with a "".5"" edition, see the extensive changes in WOTC's 3.0 to 3.5 Conversion Guide: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qY-FcAjOGCjufok_gebnXd70KY0DBE6h/view?usp=sharing

SUMMARY from the Megathread:

1278,pVOXa5mB1OU,The Rules Lawyer,"NEW PATHFINDER 2E CRPG!? (UPDATE: It is an action rpg, 1st of two projects. See pinned comment)","Update: it is an action RPG. 
Teaser trailer (I consider it mildly spoilery for those playing Abomination Vaults on tabletop): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnCIYR5-_KA
Kickstarter page: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bkomstudios/pathfinder-abomination-vaults

A previous announcement was that BKOM Studios is doing 2 video games, with a smaller project being announced first. (That data point should have tipped me off!) BKOM should have been clearer in their initial teaser yesterday. I'm disappointed that it is not a turn-based RPG, but it does exceed my expectations of what their first game would be!

---PREVIOUSLY---
Addressing some skepticism online:
1. ""We don't know it's a CRPG""? We need confirmation that it uses the 2E ruleset. If it doesn't, then they are f***ing up by raising expectations. But it is based an Adventure Path that uses the Pathfinder 2e rules, and not on a board game (which BKOM's Tales from Candlekeep: Tomb of Annihilation was).
2. Why is it crowdfunding? Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous were done with Kickstarters. There's a number of advantages to crowdfunding, including absorbing risk that small- and mid-size companies like Paizo and BKOM can't pay for. We will learn more.

1281,jkEoqhtZqF8,The Rules Lawyer,D&D movie's modest performance means aggressive monetization of D&D (Part 1 of my movie trilogy),"CORRECTIONS/ADDITIONS: 
-Folks who still have hope should remember that the SRD that went out into the Creative Commons only has a slice of the rules. Like now, playing D&D 5e on VTTs like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds require paying a premium, and part of those companies' costs is a result of their arrangement with WOTC which WOTC has the bargaining leverage in. WOTC has no reason NOT to effectively kill support for the new edition on those platforms, either by not extending the full rules to them or by making it prohibitively expensive to consumers.
-At 11:13, $200-300 million was spent on the DIGITAL INITIATIVE, not just engineers. This includes the $146 million acquisition of D&D Beyond.

1282,MNS1N4dohp0,The Rules Lawyer,"Pathfinder's crunchy rules ENABLE roleplaying, not hinder it! (Moments from Outlaws of Alkenstar)","A common thing heard among tabletop players is that crunchy rules ""get in the way of roleplaying."" But crunchy systems like Pathfinder 2e can actually ENABLE roleplaying. Here are clips from our 2nd Outlaws of Alkenstar session showing exactly that!

The Ash mystery for the Oracle class, which is the star of this video: https://2e.aonprd.com/Mysteries.aspx?ID=10

CORRECTION: 
4:14 - Inspire Courage has the auditory trait. As a Composition (see the trait), it must use a performance, and that performance must be auditory if it has a Verbal Component. (This also happens to match the fluff description in the spell.) Anyway, it was a rules mistake, but still doesn't counter the video's main point =D

1284,zgdyswPElQ8,The Rules Lawyer,Lawyer analyzes the ORC License: Is it better than the Creative Commons used by D&D?,"During the OGL debacle, Paizo announced an effort to create a system-neutral open license (ORC License) for TTRPGs, which Pathfinder will be published under going forward.

I'm a gamer and lawyer and try to answer these questions:
-After being forced not to revoke the Open Gaming License, Wizards of the Coast put D&D's rules in the Creative Commons... DOES that actually foster open gaming for D&D?
-Shouldn't other TTRPG publishers do the same? Why develop a different license? 
-What the hell do these words mean?

1286,oSH31vVG9DA,The Rules Lawyer,Paizo and BKOM announce TWO PATHFINDER VIDEO GAMES! Will we get a PF2e CRPG!? (The Rules Lawyer),"LINK to the press release: https://email.paizo.com/4XTJ-JRYB-75D777944812E8A772FGC76CA4AB2FBF807017/cr.aspx

One more piece of context: Paizo partnered with Obsidian to make an excellent adaptation of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. That did not prevent them from also licensing the Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous CRPGs, which were done by Owlcat Games.

BKOM's Tales from Candlekeep: Tomb of Annihilation game adapted the D&D Tomb of Annihilation board game. I believe THAT game is rooted in D&D 4E? Since PF2e shares DNA with 4e this might make sense.","['rules lawyer', 'rpg', 'crpg', 'pathfinder', 'pathfinder 2e', 'pathfinder 2nd', 'pf2', 'pf2e', 'video game', 'videogame', 'bkom', 'candlekeep', 'tomb of annihilation']",2023-04-06T16:00:35Z,9468,510,,101,PT8M25S,hd,false

Pathfinder: DMs have to homebrew and ban things in D&D 5e (Rules Lawyer chats with MrRhexx),"People should know the context for these conversations: MrRhexx wanted to express misgivings he has about Pathfinder 2e before publishing his own video about Pathfinder 2e, as a way of doing 'research' to not say something flatly wrong or ignorant about what the other side is. So the whole nature of the conversation is focused on what gives him pause about PF2. He also homebrews 5e and bans spells, and does the extra work a DM needs to do to make combat fun and exciting in 5e, especially at high levels. And he has no ""rose-colored glasses"" about WOTC's shortcomings in this regard. He loves the combat in Pathfinder 2e and wants to keep playing in the campaign! I think that is what is most important right now and what separates him from other people whose opinions some folks may have encountered online.

Also, the ""turn marker"" people were asking about is called COMBAT BOOSTER. (The spiritual successor to Turn Marker.)

1302,a_Sz8Pe5rp0,The Rules Lawyer,How Pathfinder 2e FIXES 1e and D&D (The Rules Lawyer),"I go into the DESIGN GOALS of Pathfinder 2nd Edition, which is the latest attempt to address issues that came up in D&D 3e/Pathfinder 1e.

This is the second ""course"" in PATHFINDER LAW SCHOOL, for people who are now checking out Pathfinder 2e!

CORRECTION(S)/ERRATA:
-At 10:10, there are some free actions that don't have a trigger like Release (releasing an object). A number of others don't have triggers per se, but they need to be done immediately before doing something else (like a wizard draining their Arcane Bond to fuel their upcoming spell).
-At 12:05, there actually is ONE more type that comes up SOMETIMES in battle, the item bonus from an alchemical item or some other effects
-If you dislike tracking conditions and their effects, digital tools like Pathbuilder, Wanderer's Guide, and VTTs let you apply them automatically.
-At 20:52, Guidance and Bless don't stack because they aid DIFFERENT kinds of checks: Guidance boosts ability checks, whereas Bless aids only attack rolls and saving throws.
-At 39:50, one of the Big Six was a statboosting item to increase your main ability score. (Belt of Giant Strength, Headband of Alluring Charisma, etc.) Shields, while a SEVENTH big item for some characters, was optional.
-At 1:04:12, I had planned to but forgotten to give credit to 4e for defining simple, streamlined uses for skills in combat.

0:00 Introduction
2:19 Overview
4:34 Complexity in combat
19:50 Complexity: stacking spells
23:59 Imbalance between characters
36:17 Complexity in character building
39:42 Magic items less wondrous
46:12 Boring melee combat
52:56 Difficult to balance encounters
1:03:15 Skills rarely used
1:06:24 Martial/caster balance, story-breaking spells

1315,CqTehyF54bc,The Rules Lawyer,"D&D YouTubers praise how Pathfinder 2e does ""multiclassing"" (The Rules Lawyer)","During Session 4 of our ""D&D YouTubers learn Pathfinder 2e"" series, d4: D&D Deep Dive (Colby) and The DM Lair (Luke) praised how PF2 handles ""multiclassing"" through its ARCHETYPE system.

ADDITIONS:
-Pathfinder 2e DOES have dual-classing, which unquestionably increases your character power, if you want your campaign to truly blend 2 the capabilities of classes. This variant is in the Gamemastery Guide and at this link, where Paizo also gives advice on the effect it has on your campaign. It is also particularly useful for smaller parties: https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1328
-What's not clear in this conversation, is how PF2e manages to allow ""free feats"" while keeping PC power in check: the improvement of your character's MATH is hardwired in your Class as it levels up. Feats tend to give more options; often they are alternative actions/activities that compete for your 3 actions.
-Pathfinder 2e builds on how D&D 4ed did multiclassing, in that you don't take levels of a class but you get abilities via feats. However, it also expands on what 4e did by (1) having additional feats for a multiclass besides those granting Powers, (2) having NON-multiclass archetypes like Beastmaster, Marshal, etc., and (3) allowing characters to have more than one ""multiclass"". You can have take a NEW archetype after taking 3 feats in your 1st archetype, for instance.

1322,V2NiN511jZs,The Rules Lawyer,WOTC's new D&D OGL statement concedes nothing. The survey is a delay tactic + diversion tactic.,"""Je participe. Tu participes. Il participe. Nous participons. Vous participez. Ils profitent.""

As Drew_585 said on my server: ""Not a good first step. It's a better trap.""

The survey is a delay tactic to try to buy time. THEY ALREADY KNOW OUR FEEDBACK: DON'T REVOKE THE OGL. And it is a diversion tactic: ""direct your comments into a space that we control and we can spin the results.""

AND it is us winning more time! More time to develop the ORC License, for third-party publishers to transition, for players and GMs to turn up the heat!

WOTC, while conceding nothing in this statement, is putting it out to cool the anger: it shows the strength of the united TTRPG community in canceling their D&D Beyond subscriptions and declaring they will no longer be subject to WOTC's dictates by uniting around publishers who will work under the Open RPG Creative License (ORC). They must resort to trying to convince us to cool our activity, because OUR ACTIVITY CAN FORCE THEIR HAND.

YouTuber Indestructoboy this morning called today ""D-Day,"" because of the expectation that WOTC would publish it's horrible new ""OGL"" that will try to shut down all other companies publishing for D&D. Today truly was a ""D-Day,"" but for an even more apt reason: the announcement of a new system-neutral, community-owned OPEN gaming license that the community can rally around to become independent from WOTC!

The new license would mean that all who publish their RPG content under it make it available for future companies to use, like the current OGL 1.0a does. And it will NOT be revocable and will be owned by no company; the plan is to give it to a nonprofit foundation (like the Linux Foundation). If the final text delivers on this promise, it DRAWS A LINE IN THE SAND against WOTC, and ALL who support open gaming should support systems who publish under it.

1334,oPV7-NCmWBQ,The Rules Lawyer,WOTC trying to REVOKE THE OGL for D&D (Lawyer-gamer shares leaked language and comments on it),"The leak is confirmed further Jan. 5 by Linda Codega, a respected gaming journalist at Gizmodo who has a copy of ""a leaked draft of the document, dated mid-December"": https://gizmodo.com/dnd-wizards-of-the-coast-ogl-1-1-open-gaming-license-1849950634

It's time to raise hell!
The community should not help WOTC lie about what this is and call it an ""OGL."" It doesn't foster ""open gaming."" In practice, it doesn't provide a stable business model for third party publishers, and in this respect is closer to the 4e GSL (Gaming System License.) (EDIT: @Fury of the Smol is calling it the CGL, or Closed Gaming License.)

Also see my pinned comment below, for additions!

1343,gIxi5ZqDiJE,The Rules Lawyer,"D&D is ""under monetized""? ""Live service tools"" and ""recurrent spending"" for D&D (Rules Lawyer)","Link to article: https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/roleplaying-game/news/dungeons-and-dragons-under-monetised-says-executives

I have posted the portions of Hasbro's presentation that are relevant to D&D players in my next video. The full Hasbro presentation (most of it covers Magic: The Gathering) has been posted online at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJpDA9CsdJQ
(It is also on Hasbro's website - google ""Hasbro presentations"" and it's the one from Dec. 8 - but it requires a (free) registration.)

Here is what stood out to me when I listened to it after shooting this video:
-They use the phrase ""live service tools"" when describing how D&D Beyond lets them get detailed live data on how D&D players use it, and get more insights into their market (and subsections of their market)
-Contrary to what I think here, they are looking at monetizing the PLAYERS more (not the DMs): 
""Dungeon masters, which are the people who guide you through the adventure, they only make up about 20 percent of the audience, but they are the largest share of our paying players. The rest of the players at the table, we believe digital will allow us to offer a lot more options to create rewarding experiences post-sale that helps us unlock the type of recurrent spending you see in digital games, where more than 70 percent of the revenue in digital gaming comes post-sale. The state of digital means that we are able to expand from what is essentially a yearly book publishing model to a recurrent spending environment, and we're offering content that we know fans want.""
-D&D, unlike Magic the Gathering, is universally recognized (comparable to Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter) and has huge potential growth that they will try to realize through a ""broad, 4 quadrant strategy"" - (assuming the 1st is the tabletop game) this includes movies, triple-AAA video games, products using Hasbro's reach to create collectibles, toys, games. 

My takeaways: This should be no surprise, but One D&D's design is only one of many priorities in what Hasbro sees as HUGE growth potential in D&D, and it is not nearly as ""sexy"" to investors (and likely to Hasbro itself) since it is less relatable and is something ""not new."" Next year's movie is timed to be the springboard for this new phase of D&D, with Baldur's Gate 3 and 6e coming out soon afterward.

ALSO: They see future growth in making D&D an online, digital game, modeling its financial potential after videogames. But videogames might not be a perfect analogy. What makes TTRPGs unique is the human element, a creative human DM, and the unique stories that come from adventures. Many people still prefer to play in-person.

1350,59ewz8CjgzY,The Rules Lawyer,"5 IMPROVEMENTS to One D&D that WOTC is not considering (""Lawyer's Critique"")","Jeremy Crawford has, after much demand, stated some design goals for 6th edition of D&D (while not calling it a new edition). This is a step forward, but WOTC's current commitment to a conservative revision is leaving intact a number of core issues with the game that I deep-dive in my other videos. But even assuming a conservative revision, there are some glaring issues that 5e players and DMs have complained about, that some simple changes could help address.

However, they are things that should be brought up early in a playtest, and not later. I go into more detail in the video.

1362,UsBRuHv5_9M,The Rules Lawyer,The NEW KINGMAKER for Pathfinder and D&D (2 of 3: Kingdom & Warfare Rules Overview),"The Kingmaker AP Player's Guide (including the Kingdom + Warfare rules) is now out! (WARNING: contains sidequest information that imo should be for GM eyes only): https://downloads.paizo.com/Kingmaker+Players+Guide.pdf

ADDITIONS: 
-The kingdom rules are ambitious and look potentially fun, but since I started playing through them to prep a follow-up video of the rules in action, I've discovered that they haven't been playtested and need some refinement. I will say more in a future video. For a preview of one issue I spotted, see this thread: https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43olo?Rules-that-hamper-a-fledgling-kingdom-in-the-AP
-The kingdom and warfare rules can be used with any TTRPG system, since the Kingdom ""character"" doesn't rely on any specifically-PF2e player stats. The ""crunch"" is significant. There are about 60 pages of kingdom rules (mostly detailing scores of activities and structures) and 20 pages of warfare rules.
-A Settlement offers items for sale up to its Level minus 2 if it lacks a General Store.

CORRECTION: I call the Companion Guide a ""necessary supplement"" which technically isn't true. You can run this without the NPCs from the CRPG and without the camping and weather rules.

ADDITION: The random encounter rate in the Camping system makes encounters too common. See this thread on the Paizo forums https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43ogm?How-am-I-misreading-the-camping-rules

1381,8tINI3opwIY,The Rules Lawyer,Teaching Adventure with 4 THAUMATURGES from Pathfinder 2e's Dark Archive! (Rules Lawyer),"CORRECTIONS:
-Fafhrd canNOT wield a shield while still gaining the extra damage from Implement's Empowerment. (That ability requires you hold nothing but one-handed weapons, implements, and esoterica in your hands, while holding an implement). Fortunately, he never had occasion to use it in these battles! =D
-Amulet's Abeyance is MORE powerful than in this video! You or your ally gains resistance to all damage equal to 2 + YOUR LEVEL (not half level). So resist all *9*!
-Shooting with a bow requires 2 hands. Here Willard and Rose still could have fired with their bows, so long as they Released their Implement from their other hand as a free action. Generally, you want a one-handed ranged weapon with the Ammunition Thaumaturgy feat, also because that lets you STILL use Implement's Empowerment's bonus damage!

1382,UQIHbdiDems,The Rules Lawyer,"""Let's play MATHFINDER!"" A loving tribute to high-level Pathfinder 2e, + teaser for my new campaign!","Approachability be damned! Pathfinder 2e is a decidedly more-complex beast as you venture into the higher levels, but the system rewards you back with high-octane, outlandish action, combat that is still balanced, and fun, surprisng interactions of crazy abilities. (For viewers unused to high level PF2e play, this will seem like an unmanageable mess. This is the FIRST session of players who don't know each other and are also getting used to their own abilities and their teammates' abilities!)

1383,SN1Y8OeZG50,The Rules Lawyer,Pathfinder 2e gets its BLASTER CASTER!? Deep Dive + Combat Demo of the PSYCHIC! (Rules Lawyer),"We deep dive into the new PSYCHIC class, one of the 2 new classes in THE DARK ARCHIVE, the new Pathfinder 2e book dealing with the occult which releases July 27th!

ADDITION: 
-For psychic spellcasting, you replace verbal actions with thought/emotion actions, AND you replace material actions with somatic actions.
--The text says ""you can't apply both an amp and a metamagic ability to a cantrip at the same time.""
CORRECTIONS (thanks to commenters who brought these up): 
-Emotional Acceptance's ""Restore the Mind"" lets you add ONE of the effects, not both.
-I made Telekinetic Rend more powerful than it should be. Its heightened entry reads as ""Heightened 2"", so it should be 2d6+2d6+8 damage (average 22), about a 40% reduction of what I do here. STILL, it's a nasty psi cantrip!
-Strain Mind deals quadruple your SPELL level to you, not your quadruple your level.

PAID-GMing:
Contact me if you are interested in paying me to GM Pathfinder 2e!

Here are the details:
-Gaming is online using Foundry. I will teach people how to use it.

-People sign-up for and pay up-front for each ""block"". The first block will be the ""summer block"" of 5 biweekly four-hour sessions. (NOTE: If you are interested in starting later than early summer, still contact me.) 

-Rate starts at $175 (effectively $35 per 4-hour session) for the block. (Session Zero and character creation would count toward this.) It would meet every two weeks. As summer ends, we can talk about whether people would like to continue.

-I'd like to run (or at least begin) published Paizo modules or adventure paths. Once I have gathered everyone interested, we will discuss campaign preference and scheduling simultaneously.

*My current plan is to accommodate three five-person groups this summer. If there is greater interest than I have room for, then I will increase this rate by $25 increments (i.e., $5/session) until they become a manageable number.

IF INTERESTED:
-Join my Discord! https://discord.gg/4ux8U843BS
-In Discord, send me a private DM by Friday, June 24, 2022 12:00 PM (Pacific time, GMT -7).
-I will get back to folks starting this weekend, to find out everyone's interests and availability, etc., etc.

1387,QIUSL1qs6Kc,The Rules Lawyer,You Can't Do THAT in D&D! - #1 (An AMAZING moment from our Pathfinder 2e adventure),"This snippet from our recent Pathfinder 2e session shows one thing that the system does that I think makes it great!

The barbarian player afterward: ""Lord i love that time lol I had a more fun time being a barbarian in that session than the whole time i was a barbarian in my very first dnd campaign... Barbarians in D&D 5E and PF2E almost plays in the exact same idea/concept: Rage, and charge at your enemies. However, ever since I learned that skills also have a use in combat as well, suddenly my choices becomes even more varied rather than my typical Barbarian in a D&D game. I can maneuver around the battlefield, jump to higher ground, demoralize or feint my enemies and all of them are viable actions and not an action wasted. You can never do that in D&D 5E since the best course of action is always to attack and that leaves me bored after a few sessions, to a point that I changed characters just so I can be engaged with the system. Even then, the amount of useful actions you can do other than attacking regardless of class is amazing. It feels like I'm actually in my own character doing those moves and maneuvers rather than a puppet master. ""

What this moment highlights about Pathfinder 2e is something I posted about on the subreddit while in my pre-Rules Lawyer form:

IS PATHFINDER 2E THE ""DARK SOULS"" OF TABLETOP RPGs?

When it was released, people were struck by how difficult its combats were. The old tactics didn’t work anymore; as with a Dark Souls boss, players had to adjust their approach. It wasn’t possible to use a single strategy for every combat. Or win the game at character creation. 

This led to frustration, with significant number of people bouncing off the game. 

Part of why Pathfinder 2 has gotten this reception is that the first adventure to come out for it, and the first Adventure Path, are notorious; they are widely considered among Pathfinder players as being more difficult than later adventures put out by its publisher Paizo. In every online forum where someone expresses frustration with Pathfinder 2, without fail, people ask them if they were playing one of these 2 adventures. They being the first adventures for Pathfinder 2, the developers were still finding their bearings inthe new system.

I, the Rules Lawyer, will be livestreaming a playthrough of Fall of Plaguestone with players from my Discord server. My server has attracted a community of people who enjoy the challenge that Pathfinder 2e gives to players. I’ll be running it straight from the book, Rules As Written. No roll will be fudged.

By playing Pathfinder 2e’s most difficult adventure without adjustments, we’ll get to answer once and for all: “Is Pathfinder too difficult?” And “Is Fall of Plaguestone too difficult?” If they do beat it, maybe we’ll be able to say legitimately: Fall of Plaguestone is Pathfinder 2e on hard mode, and you can win at Pathfinder 2 if you put your mind to it. So “git gud.”

To watch our experiment and see if our intrepid players will survive, subscribe now to my side channel “Rules Lawyer Discord Community Channel”, where we will be streaming it live! The link is in the video description. So, is Pathfinder 2e the Dark Souls of RPGs?

(I expect some people will chime in to say that old-school D&D is more difficult than Pathfinder 2e. I'm not denying that; but Dark Souls rarely kills your character with random chance. And every old-school DM runs their game differently, often protecting their players to some extent from the harshness of the rules. Pathfinder 2e moves away from that school of design, and presents an amount of danger that can be overcome with sound tactics... or at least that's the intention. In the case of Fall of Plaguestone, maybe it claims the lives of characters unfairly. We shall see!)

1406,W6dionuX9ec,The Rules Lawyer,FIX D&D Stealth + Hiding: LET's LEARN Pathfinder 2e's rules (Part 1: Rules Explanation),"Pathfinder 2e's stealth + hiding rules are better than those for D&D 5e, but they are presented poorly. This video will help you! In the next video, I'll demonstrate all of Pathfinder 2e's stealth and hiding rules in an exciting (1 hour, 15 minute!) combat example!

USEFUL FLOWCHART (creator unknown): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/445719915333156864/802265943937122334/unknown.png

0:00 Introduction
2:33 Overview of D&D 5e's rules
7:43 Pathfinder 2e's rules
8:19 States of awareness
11:08 Hide
14:41 Create a Diversion
15:44 Sneak
18:36 Effects obscuring sight
20:14 Senses
23:08 Invisibility
25:08 Unnoticed
27:04 Seek
28:25 Point Out
29:27 Using these rules in D&D 5e

CORRECTIONS:
-Seek lets you target a 15' radius area (""15-foot burst"") within line of sight. (It doesn't have to be around yourself.)
-Uh oh, a rules contradiction in PF2! Pathfinder 2e's invisibility spell says you become Undetected to creatures. But the Invisible condition says: ""If you’re already observing a creature when it becomes invisible, it starts out hidden, since you know where it was when it became invisible, though it can then Sneak to become undetected."" The spell description doesn't work within the context of the PF2 system, so I think the latter (and my video!) win out here. :) But alas, it is an instance where PF2 has a contradiction.

ADDITION: Would cover protect a defender if you snuck behind cover adjacent to them, thus possibly negating the benefit of catching them Flat-footed? I'd say generally no. Cover is not always reciprocal: If I successfully snuck to behind this wall corner, the wall's not really a problem for me in stabbing you. In general, if something stays at least Hidden, I'd rule no cover for the defender because they're not aware enough. (Also, it doesn't come up often and better to reward the player.)

CORRECTION: Thanks to rylandrc for finding this rule which saves the hapless bird companion under #5: """"If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm."" So the bird would Fly in place (if falling would damage it and leave it prone)

1410,CWWH9GjfNGk,The Rules Lawyer,Let's FIX RECALL KNOWLEDGE in Pathfinder 2e (The Rules Lawyer),"Recall Knowledge is too weak for players, and too unclear for game masters in Pathfinder 2e. Let's fix it!

===========================
As requested, a written summary of my houserules with regard to recalling knowledge about a creature:
(Keep a list of everyone's knowledge skill bonuses behind the GM screen.)

1. PC Recalls Knowledge on X, and may ask a specific question about it (i.e., does it have a weakness)? Rolls d20
2. GM applies one or more of that PC's skills to the d20 roll.
DC X for the question they answered (can be Simple DC or a Level-based DC appropriate to that question)
Level-based DC based on creature's Level, to completely identify the creature

Additionally:
-You can repeat a failed R.K. in combat, but not outside combat.
-PCs with R.K. feats like Monster Hunter, etc.: use the Level-based DC of the monster.

===========================
ADDITION: I also like this suggestion from a commenter on Reddit - ""If a PC was Investigating as their exploration activity, they get one free Recall Knowledge at the start of combat.""

3:21 The Recall Knowledge action
5:31 Overview of the problems
6:56 #1: Using one skill
11:50 Problem situation
13:28 #2: Conflating IDing with asking questions

22:33 #5: The Critical Failure effect
25:52 #6: Unthematic weakening of core abilities

1411,ibNpTi-VHpg,The Rules Lawyer,"Making Alchemy Not Suck in Pathfinder 2e, Part 1: BOMBS (The Rules Lawyer)","Are Alchemists too weak in Pathfinder 2nd edition? We explore that in a series of videos where I go over ALCHEMICAL ITEMS and how to USE THEM WELL. In this 1st video I cover bombs!

CORRECTIONS: 
-I say that the Deafened condition hampers spellcasting in this video, but the Verbal spellcasting action does not have the auditory trait. So by RAW, it does not affect spellcasting. Strange! Seeking a confirmation from Paizo...
-I strongly imply that the Enduring Alchemy feat will extend a bomb you make from Quick Alchemy extend to your next turn, but its effect is limited to ""alchemical tools or elixirs""
-Bomber's Eye Elixir lessens the circumstance to AC from cover. Raised Shields do not provide cover to the wielder, however.
ADDITION: Commenter Tamadesthi has the great idea of alchemists using their Powerful Alchemy class feature to make the blindpepper bomb (""fantasy tear gas"") useful against all levels of enemies, since it uses their Class DC!

For those interested: /u/Ediwir on Reddit has created this guide for Alchemist options and items: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dl7BydLgwVCmTQyOPRxqbXjd7XLG-xmESU4Svs-5P54/edit

For more content of my GMing, check out my related ""Rules Lawyer Discord Community"" channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheRulesLawyerLivePlay

My teaching style on my channel has meant that I've gotten requests to post videos of me GMing. Here I run the BEGINNER BOX adventure with new players to Pathfinder 2e! (I'm a lawyer who teaches and runs tabletop RPGs (Pathfinder, D&D, Starfinder), usually with kids and teens.)

GM: ""A giant rat the size of a dog emerges from the dark, and it's not alone!""
Carmine: ""F*** you!""

These amazing players haven't met before! They are from around the world, and most have experience with D&D 5e but not PF2e. We were brought together by the ENDLESS TALE TAVERN campaign. This is a shared campaign on my Discord server, where the characters are at a central adventuring hub that has interplanar gates to whatever PF2E campaigns/adventures GMs want to run.

I likely will post weekly until we're done with the Beginner Box.

I teach Foundry to some PF2e GMs new to Foundry. I thought this would be a good format for people learning it, who can have their Foundry open and follow while watching. It is a FULL tutorial/walkthrough of Foundry and my most important modules! It also has a couple modules not included in my previous Foundry video.

FOR BEST RESULTS: Already have Foundry installed on your machine. Having your server already set-up is not necessary.

Foundry Version 9, Build 242 on Jan. 23, 2022.

There are many other great modules for Foundry out there! If you think to yourself, “I wonder if there’s a way to do X?”, there likely is a mod for it!

For further deciding on what modules to install, don’t miss my video on modules! It has some mods that I don’t demonstrate here:

WHY THIS QUASI-WESTMARCHES CAMPAIGN?
As a way for people in The Rules Lawyer (TRL) Discord to play Pathfinder 2e together. Elements of a Westmarches format are borrowed to allow both GMs and players to organize and play PF2e games without having to commit to a longer adventure. 

THE PREMISE
There is a hub of gates and an as-yet-undefined area around it. Behind the gates, GMs can run their own campaign settings. Golarion is one such setting. At the same time, all characters are PF2e mechanically, with no homebrew. The abilities that different deities give their followers still work in “the Westmarches area.”

At this time, we are simply trying to facilitate the GMs running what they want, and many adventures will lie beyond the various gates. We will “draw in” the town and area around the hub of gates, and there may be more connective tissue between adventures, as need arises and inspiration strikes. 

I really like Evil Sean’s proposal of how, in-world, this “adventuring system” operates:
“My narrative linkage for this campaign is the Endless Tale Tavern. The ETT has numerous openings into structures across Golarion (or whatever game world we see fit) and as such can be used as a fast transport system to take adventures from one place to another. Various agents (the GMs) hire adventurers to jobs. The tavern serves as a hub for all business adventure related. Agents have standard adventuring contracts that dictate all treasure recovered by the party will be handed over to the agent for a standard sum. Violation of this agreement causes the adventurers to be banned from the tavern.”

(The Rules Lawyer) (see time stamps),"This probably doesnt make for very interesting watch because this is the first time we've tried this. Next time we will have all participants on voice chat and display participants' chat. (My priority was to first figure out a smooth play experience for the participants, and also I was concerned some might not participate if they found out their audio would be recorded.) The most interesting part is probably the wrap-up at the end starting 3:08:45 where we all share thoughts about the battle. 

And we will try other formats. We are talking about ideas future live play events! Join us on the discord to join the discussion. Currently there is talk about bestiary-summoning battles, and possibly a bracket structure.

PROPOSED RULES (subject to change):
I will share a livestream of my screen which will be running Foundry Virtual Tabletop. 

Initial DRAFTING phase:
1. People sign up to be a ""Martial"" or a ""Caster"" on the Discord (for people joining in on the Stream, they need to be in Discord so they can DM me or the Paralegals (""the Judges""))
2. One list for each side will be maintained, in order of sign-up (people who DECLARE A SIDE on this channel are signing up and lock themselves into the order by doing so, ahead of people who sign up during the stream)
3. The 1st person on each list is admitted as a pair.
4. They each declare which pregen they take. We are using the Level 1 pregens of the iconic characters. There only pregens for the Core Rulebook and Advanced Player's Guide. (The alchemist is not allowed.)* 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-nRZlewTTKxYAZpW_wQowSsqkcWEAOLO?usp=sharing
(NOTE: There can't be taking a 2nd of a pregen, until ALL of the pregens for that side are chosen). They do this by sending a DM to the Judges (there will be a special server Role for the Judges) WITHIN A TIME LIMIT (15 sec?). If time runs out, the Judges randomly roll that player's pregen.
5. I'll try to make the map have a chess-like grid (with coordinates) to facilitate play. Those 2 players also DM the Judges their starting square within a TIME LIMIT.
6. If there no longer is at least one player in both lists, TRL announces ""last call"" for people to sign up.
7. Return to #3. 

COMBAT
(NOTE: There won't be any invisible tokens on the map (the Undetected condition won't exist). We have only a single stream.)
0a. Any long-duration effects may be started up until T minus 1 minute. People also declare what they hold in their hands. (Answer all questions on what actions it takes to retrieve/use items now.) Then 1 minute passes where every character must do nothing for 10 turns.
0b. People who want to Avoid Notice for initiative may declare they are. Otherwise Perception will be used for initiative.
0c. Roll Initiative. All ties go to the one with the higher modifier. Remaining ties are resolved by a roll-off.
1. TRL declares someone's turn has begun. The Combat Ready! module will be onscreen to visualize the time limit (30 sec?). NOTE: I have noticed that there is a delay between what happens on my screen and when people see it, maybe 10 sec. So I need a moderator who is viewing things on the watchers' end to be the one who actually declares their time has run out
2. Within that time limit, someone must already declare their first action/activity. After resolving that, TRL will act in their discretion and may ""call time"" (and may hold a sandtimer to up to the camera!) as a time limit on their next action/activity. (NOTE: In my experience, imposing a time limit for someone's whole turn sometimes lead to unfair situations, such as if someone were to cast Burning Hands and more time is needed to resolve Saving Throws and damage, etc.)
3. When someone's turn is done, TRL advances the turn and the timer starts for the next character in initiative. 

Miscellaneous Rules
- TRL will not prompt players about whether to use their Reaction. Depending on the stream delay, TRL will have to sloooow down within reason (e.g., walking past a Fighter).
- Victory is declared when a majority of the still-alive characters on one side resigns, or all characters on one side are dead.

The ARENA MAP and rules for arena features are in the Discord!
https://discord.gg/bpyqxhwe8X

*I have experience running tournaments and am keeping limited in terms of what characters you can have, because (1) we don't know how much participation there'll be, (2) people can sign up last-minute (this first event at least), and (3) this is the first event of its kind! (Who knows how long this will take?)

- TIEBREAKER IF TIME RUNS OUT: During initial chat, TRL will declare a time limit for the whole battle (based on people saying how long they can play). When a full Round is resolved after that time limit, the combat ends. Each side's then-current % of starting HP is compared, and victory goes to the side that has more % of original HP.
- If a player must drop out for whatever reason, they must tell the Judges before their next turn starts if that character's next turn is not to be fully wasted. When that happens, the Judges will ask the stream who wants to replace that player.

1430,53Bd1iinpBY,The Rules Lawyer,A memorable moment from my Pathfinder 2e / D&D campaign with kids,"No long video this week because of this week’s SPECIAL EVENT (subscribe and ring the bell!). 

I gamemaster kids and teens, and I’ve gotten requests to share gameplay so people can see how I run my games.

No grand insights in this one... but it does show why I like GMing young people!

*** SPOILERS for Pathfinder Society Scenario 4-01, “Rise of the Goblin Guild” ***
This is a side quest from our Rise of the Runelords campaign, and the party is Level 6. The party stopped a botched robbery attempt by a charismatic goblin named Ekkie who talks to dead brother’s skull. She was trying to get herself recruited into a goblin gang, but decided to team up with the party to raid the gang’s hideout. This is what ensues when they confront the gang’s leader.

NOTE! Some of these modules require installing a small ‘helper’ module. Foundry will tell you when those are needed. These are easily installed via the Foundry setup screen.

Here is a JSON file with all the modules I say I use in the video, plus:

(You can import this into your Game World using the “Forien’s Copy Environment” module.)

Foundry also supports integrated Audio/Video chat. I use it in my campaigns, and using Jitsi improves the performance, but the setup for Jitsi is quite involved. See Encounter Library’s excellent tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSLM9wASduU

1433,EmitEnoyAlQ,The Rules Lawyer,Watch a LEVEL 20 BOSS FIGHT in Pathfinder 2e! | Does high-level play WORK?!,"Inconceivable! Level 20 isn’t supposed to work in Pathfinder or D&D! Let's talk about the problems of high-level play in RPGs, then do a Level 20 combat in Pathfinder 2e and look at how it addresses those problems. (Running time: 86 minutes)

CORRECTIONS (can never be perfect can I?): 
*The rules explicitly let the GM allow a character to use a Reaction before their first turn of combat, depending on circumstances. 
*The Fighter resists slashing 4, which affects the Claw attacks. 
*The Rogue's debilitating strikes did not deal +2d6 precision damage immediately: they debuffed the dragon so that the Rogue's future attacks until the end of her next turn did +2d6 precision damage. 
*The wizard at 52 10 cannot Dismiss the punishing winds spell (a spell must explicitly allow you to Dismiss it); fortunately, it requires him to Sustain it for it not to end at the end of his turn anyway. (And he didn't have a 4th action to Dismiss it!) 
*By default, polymorph spells (like Avatar) prevent spellcasting, but the rules say the GM may still allow spellcasting regardless.

CALL TO ACTION! :(
The Haste spell specifies that your 4th action must be a Strike action or the ""Stride"" action, which indeed is different from the Fly action. This has to be errata'd. Because, by the same token, since some characters with an animal companion can have their companion ""Stride or Strike"" when it's not Commanded that turn, then a bird companion needs to land on the ground and waddle to move then. Makes zero sense. And I see little value in limiting Haste to only land Speeds. Started a thread about it here, where I propose allowing Haste to be Heightened to include other Speed types: https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/qq8u4x/this_rule_needs_to_change/

1434,F2DRiUvnOEM,The Rules Lawyer,"Tactics in a BRUTAL Boss Fight in Pathfinder 2e (Deleted from ""Illusion of Choice? Tactics Pt. 2"")","Grab some popcorn, kick up your heels and get comfy, 'cause this one's a doozy! MMO-style ""rotations"" have even less of a place when our Level 5 heroes fight a BOSS. This is the deleted combat from PART 2 of my series on Tactics & Strategies in Pathfinder 2e.

For the full experience, the original video began with (and ended with the conclusion of) ""Let's Test the ""Illusion of Choice"" of Pathfinder 2e in a Combat - Tactics & Strategies Part 2!"" If I had kept it in, it would've been 2.5 hours! (Did I really just make a feature-length film?) 
CONCLUSION AT: https://youtu.be/p5xV7BOFwyw?t=4762

Also see PART 1 ""This Ain't D&D: Tactics + Strategies for Pathfinder 2e, Part 1 (Basic/Skill Actions)"", where a Level 1 party fights a Giant Scorpion:
https://youtu.be/PRq0VaN1-XE

ADDITIONS: At 44:35, the Fighter missed a chance to use an Attack of Opportunity on the specter. Also, I had planned to (but didn't find a place to) highlight how the Swashbuckler can also gain Panache by succeeding on a check while doing ""a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery,"" at the GM's discretion.

ADDITIONS: 
-The separation of the book into Guns and Gears makes it easier for a GM to allow only a portion into their campaign. The Gunslinger's alternate emphasis on crossbows let's a GM to allow the class while not necessarily bringing in firearms.
-The book includes dozens of Common, Uncommon and Rare backgrounds. (There is a rare background of being ""Wished Alive""... a la Pinocchio!)

Wizards of the Coast Announced a ""next evolution"" of Dungeons & Dragons, with new versions of the core rulebooks, to be released in 2024. The surveys they started this year will continue into 2022. They have not released details, but there's no time better than now to say what we think they should do.

I'm a fan of Pathfinder 2nd Edition, and there are 5 things I think that D&D easily can implement to improve the game for players.

1441,SXhDGfgavqw,The Rules Lawyer,The THAUMATURGE PLAYTEST for Pathfinder 2e: Is It Too Strong? (A Rules Lawyer Briefing),"(Sorry the music gets too loud at times during the demo!)
In today's Briefing, the Rules Lawyer analyzes the Thaumaturge Playtest and does a demonstration combat. Is it too strong? What Implements are you most interested in, and what do you think of the Playtest? Comment below!

CORRECTIONS: 
-At 18:05, only a REGULAR failure on the save triggers the additional effect. 
-The iconic thaumaturge's name is Mio*s*
-At 36:32, the correct sequence was to apply Weakness 2 next, as the last step of calculating damage. This would have made the incoming damage 11. Then, the skeletal champion would have had the choice of using its Shield Block reaction against it, because the trigger is ""would take damage from a physical attack."" (This means that Shield Block cannot block damage BEFORE triggering one's weakness!)
-At 42:28, I forgot to apply the skeleton's resistance to piercing damage. (The thaumaturge's ability doesn't negate resistances - only ""triggers"" weaknesses.)

EDITS: I change my mind (partially) on what I say about PF1's Kineticist at the end of the video. Also, I forget to say here that Distant Grasp is more about blasting, Infinite Eye is more about buffing, and Silent Whisper is more about de-buffing. Lastly, in the combat example the Psychic would have had obvious sound and visual manifestations to her magic; Psychic spellcasting is no more secret in the playtest. And her Telekinetic Rend calls for a *Fortitude* save.

1443,j4syvdM5fy8,The Rules Lawyer,Top 10 Reasons Pathfinder 2e is EASIER to run than D&D 5e!,"Does the huge amount of homebrew and channels for D&D 5e reflect 5e's popularity, or the fact that 5e players feel they need to fill in gaps and improve upon things that WOTC puts out? I would argue it's mostly the latter...

In this Rules Lawyer video, I dip my toe into the turbulent Edition Wars!

ADDITIONS: If you use Foundry VTT and get a PDF of a published PF2e adventure, you can import all of its maps (with all maps drawn) and artwork with a single click! See this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlTjzFhQAU4

It's been pointed out that I get some rules wrong when discussing 5e rules for invisible creatures. While looking at the source text myself, I found it very... unclear and opaque. Because when you're invisible you already are detected by the noise or tracks you make (p. 291). So without making noise or making tracks, you're already undetected, right? So what does Hide (p. 192) do? On that page it says follow the rules in Chapter 7. There (on p. 177), the box on Hiding isn't very useful. Apparently the enemy still knows where you are and you have to do the Hide action to... hide? It never makes clear anywhere what ""hiding"" does. And even if you hide and you aren't invisible, walking up to a creature after hiding reveals you, except ""under certain circumstances."" So it's entirely up to the GM. So I think I correctly identify the problem of lack of Rules Clarity, but end up proving it in a different way, by getting rules wrong that aren't very helpful or clear anyway.

Some commenters emphasize that PF2e is harder to learn and is harder for certain people and styles of gaming, which is fair. But I'd add that, even with a brand-new GM, PF2e's Beginner Box is probably the easiest way to learn either system. I hope to cover this in a future video!

Here's a good video from GideonsGaming that makes a similar point:
""Pathfinder 2e's Excessive Rules Make It Simple"":

1447,PRq0VaN1-XE,The Rules Lawyer,"This Ain't D&D: Tactics + Strategies for Pathfinder 2e, Part 1 (Basic/Skill Actions)","Here we look at the notorious difficulty of Pathfinder 2e fights and cover general strategies, Basic Actions, and Skill Actions that ALL characters can use to overcome them. In a 2nd video, we will look at many of these same concepts with higher-level characters who have more Feats.

PART 2 at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xV7BOFwyw

CORRECTIONS: The wizard normally would need 1 action to Interact and take out his scroll. Valeros' knock-out at 40:55 should've moved him to right before the scorpion in initiative; it has no effect here because he Delays anyway. Goblin Song would not have worked against the scorpion, since it is a singing Performance and therefore has the linguistic trait, and there's no shared language. (Makes sense!) Also, Create a Diversion either involves words (auditory + linguistic traits), or doing a ""trick"" (manipulate trait). Because Merisiel didn't share a language with the scorpion, she could only try to Create a Diversion (standing where she was) by provoking the scorpion's Attack of Opportunity. (AoO's are nasty!)

ADDITIONS: Actions with the attack trait, such as Trip, Grapple, Shove, and Disarm, are subject to and contribute to the Multiple Attack Penalty. (This makes Assurance: Athletics a great skill feat to take!, because you can use Athletics while ignoring all bonuses that aren't your proficiency bonus and all penalties.) Also, by default creatures do not get reactions before their 1st turn. However, the rules state that the GM can allow a creature to get one. Here, since the two sides were aware of each other and the scorpion was prepared to fight before Merisiel initiated combat, as the GM I think I would've allowed the scorpion to use AoO against Merisiel.

1448,fLnmENaQykE,The Rules Lawyer,Martials and clerics are FUN in Pathfinder 2e! Plus memorable monsters in our Second Combat,"Playing a martial character or a cleric doesn't have to be boring! Also, we look at PF2e's refreshing approach to monster design. In this next demonstration, the fighter VALEROS and the rogue MERISIEL from our 'First Combat' join the goblin cleric POOG from our 'Character Creation' video, to take on a necromancer and his retinue of undead abominations!

1450,jafxucfk0PY,The Rules Lawyer,Pathfinder 2nd Edition is easy to learn! A First Combat,"A video where I try to dispel the idea that Pathfinder 2E is too complicated to understand, using an introductory combat scenario. I also try to highlight the interesting choices that come about in 2E's 3-action system. I'm a lawyer and regularly run TTRPGs with kids -- I hope my experience teaching helps others! 

CLARIFICATION at 8:53 : Strikes can critically fail, but by the default rules this usually has no effect. Some player feats and monster abilities care about this but that is the minority of cases. Paizo also releases Critical Hit and Critical Fumble cards to spice up those natural 20s and 1s!

19:46 - Rogue Being a Badass
21:05 - Final Comments

NOTE: My explanation of the Flatfooted condition got left on the cutting room floor... It imposes a -2 circumstance penalty to Armor Class (AC)! So flanking the goblin pyro allowed the Rogue to get +10 above its AC and get a critical hit!
