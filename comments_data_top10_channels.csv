Any player who min-maxes has either had bad experiences with prior DMs who didn't understand the true purpose of playing the game, or has this distorted view of 'beating the DM' and also fails to understand the point of the game...or you know, they could be me as a player who constantly rolls like hot garbage.

All that we ever do is call upon our experience and influence and filter it through our imperfect perception when we create art. Artists create pieces of culture, AI only threatens art being sold for commission due to the speed of production. Lastly, there is a human that created that AI, and anyone with a background in coding will tell you that the intricacies of just creating an AI like that is a form of art in and of itself. I’m sorry artists of the world, but capitalism won’t let you have your cake and eat it too. Your passion will rarely be what puts bread in the cabinet. I realize that’s callous, but this feels a sculptor yelling at painters for stealing potential customers\n\n*Edit: I am in favor of artists using software to poison AI as well, I just hate the “AI art isn’t art” argument', 'Makes sense, Paizo can afford to hire artists. Some of the AI algoritms currently have some ethical issues in how they trained though. Its perfectly possible to train an AI on stock, pd and art purchased art from a handful of artists in a genre. I use it to generate infinite character portraits on a hobby project, its quite amazing and beyond anything I can commission.\n\nLets me honest here, any artists who took good money to work with training an art AI would be burned at a metaphorical stake as a class traitor lol, I kinda get it as a code monkey, but chose to use AI to increase my productivity, sure it will probably replace me in a decade but thats going to happind no matter what, most working horse artists need to come to terms with the same.', 'Thank you for the thoughtful video. I\'m going to share my perspective in a second, but first want to preface it with this: I wholly support Paizo\'s decision, and I think it\'s something more studios and publishers should consider taking a stance on like this. I am also an artist (mostly vector illustration, but I also do pen and ink drawings and a buttload of other things that are less fun). I agree that a learning machine using someone else\'s copyrighted works is immoral.\n\nHowever.\n\nThis situation is fairly complicated, and I think a good portion of what makes it complicated is precisely how the AI are generating art. As you describe in the video, the learning machines are fed samples / training materials and given feedback over a long period of iterations which help to create algorithms and patterns that are more accurate to what people expect to be seeing. If I say ""give me a photorealistic duck"" I would expect to see a duck that looks real, etc. But it does not do this by snatching a picture someone drew and splicing that picture into other pictures. It does this through understanding natural language, and building a map or database of what various concepts mean, and what kinds of existing material might fit those concepts. When I say duck, it scours its databases to understand what ""duck"" means. The word duck can be ambiguous, do I mean the verb ""to duck""? What about the more abstract expression ""ducking consequences""? It settles on figuring out that I\'m talking about a noun, and then has to figure out which noun I mean. Duck could refer to aquatic vehicles, birds, or probably a bunch of other stuff that pops up. But somehow it deduces that I *probably* mean the bird, and then it figures out what a duck looks like. It views millions of different images, and begins to understand concepts like body structure, relative size, things like ""it has feathers"" and ""it has a face"", etc. It builds a profile of a duck, and then uses the images out there to begin understanding how to assemble ""from scratch""* its own duck. When I say from scratch, I mean that it isn\'t using an existing image as the pixel-grounds for whatever it\'s making. It\'s using many images to understand the general, and specific, ways that that kind of image might look. Including things like ""ducks are probably on the water"", or ""a duck might have several ducklings behind it"", or ""the water it\'s on may be surrounded by trees"", etc. What it creates is then a wholly unique (totally distinguishable from others)  individual image of a duck.\n\nSo here\'s the problem: Signatures. And more broadly, words in general. Learning machines don\'t exactly know what these are when they see them in images - though it can gather ideas like ""this shape is a word"" and even ""This shape is the letter A"" or whatever, though up to this point it sucks at actually designing and implementing words. But it\'s *getting those* ideas from other images. Signatures for example, as you mentioned, are a common thing you\'ll find an artist\'s work. And it\'s true that MANY of the images programs like Midjourney create are most likely pulling artists\' copyrighted images as sources for what it is computing and designing. However, it isn\'t necessarily ripping off this one person\'s signature. It sees that a bunch of source images have a weird scribble down here in this corner, so it adds one that resembles them. And yes, it may resemble them closely. And yes, the images where a real artist\'s signature appears on an AI-generated work is probably more likely to appear on a work that looks like their actual copyrighted work (since that\'s where the source came from).\n\nYes, this is immoral, but it\'s also very complicated. Because of *how* these machines are doing this, there is probably a somewhat valid argument that could be made (in a court of law) that AI-generating machines are tools created by programmers, which those programmers are effectively using to generate their own art, and that the source images they\'re pulling are no different from a human artist seeing someone else\'s art and being inspired.\n\nIt is different, yes, but my point is that this argument could be made, and it could be defended, by people who are invested enough in establishing the legality of what\'s going on. Is it going to happen? Probably not. Should it? Absolutely not. Because if that argument becomes the primary discourse, we have to closely examine what it means for a human to be creatively inspired and set about making their own works, and then figure out if those concepts apply to the AI themselves, or to the humans who designed the AI. It\'s messy as fuck. It could go in a lot of terrible directions. What isn\'t going to change, though, is that learning machines exist, and they will almost undoubtedly have access to anything on the internet. That\'s kind of just the way of it. If you can google it, you can see it. If an AI can google it, it can see it too. Now, it could be very useful to establish some ground rules for companies who are producing programs like Midjourney, DALL-E, and the like. But there are relatively few companies that are doing that, and FAR MORE individual programmers who have their own personal instances of learning machine systems and can operate way outside any laws if they\'re doing it privately.\n\nAnyway, I\'m not really making an argument here. I agree with what you\'re saying from an ethical perspective, but I don\'t think the way you\'re explaining how these things work is painting a fair picture of what they actually do, or of the innate complexities of the problem. This is, truly, a philosophical problem, and I\'m sitting here munchin popcorn watching how it\'s going to unfold, because it is FASCINATING.', 'I will give Paizo the benefit of the doubt regarding their ""moral reasons"" for why they don\'t allow AI art. \n\nBut really the most relevant reason is probably that fact that AI art is not copyrightable, meaning that they can\'t sell or force legal actions for distributing it. Assuming there is a certain level of modification required to make the art copyrighted, that limit is still not clear and there is a risk in accepting modified AI art-work.\n\nThe biggest users will likely be people who do not care about copyright at all, like TTRPG players who want to have avatars for their characters.', 'no clue what paizo is', '""AI"" generated stuff is not immoral to use or even post its just when you go straight from ""prompt to print"" and try to market what is effectively a few words typed into a suped up search engine is where it gets murky', ""Don't ever tell the Geth that. 😅""]"

While idk if there is a spot that SPECIFICALLY states this, it is generally assumed that the days are split up into 3 segments: Long rest (aka sleeping) is 8 hours of your day, another 8 hours is generally given as your adventuring time, dungeoneering, exploration, travel, etc., leaving the last 8 hours to be used for your standard DT activities. The obviously 4 or more days for crafting can be arduous depending on the kind of campaign you’re running, but it also doesn’t say that’s ALL your character is doing. It’s assumed, even with RAW, that your character is working on things during that DT period each day. The new system does work wonders for consumables (cuz lets face it, it SHOULDN’T take the same time to brew a batch of potions/elixirs of healing as it takes to craft a suit of full plate armor! That was just f*ing ridiculous). Another thing to keep in mind is that just about every basic weapon and armor in the game is only lvl 0-2 in the standard equipment section of the CRB. Making those will be really easy and quicker, and all you’re having to worry about is the runes to put on them. If your players are smart, they’re focusing on making runestones (only a lvl 1 consumable item, so it could take as little as 4hrs to make one) to transfer runes off of gear they find (which only takes 1day in the CRB to transfer runes), to the stone and then to their own gear, to speed that upgrade process along. And as a GM, you’re of course free to mix the two rules together from the CRB or TV to suit the needs of your table. The only time either of those rules might be a problem is a sanctioned PFS game, where you may not be able to mix/fudge the rules like that. Personally, as Dwarven Alchemist (Chirurgeon) character, I love the new rules in our game because it allows me to do my job much better! 4hrs to brew a batch of elixirs?

I mean seriously, spell strike, expansive spell strike, and scroll striker along with all the scroll feats on a Thamaturge means once per combat you can spell strike ANY VIABLE SPELL IN THE GAME. Not to mention with using the setup action for enhance vulnerability on your weapon you get fighter level proficiency with it.

It advances skills that the thaumaturge is already suited for and then uses those skills to activate a powerful aura that helps the thaumaturge and allies be effective. With the thaumatuge's high cha but lackluster to hit bonus, inspiring marshall stance seems like a perfect match. If you take mirror or chalice, then adding more actions might not be a benefit, but otherwise, it seems like the way to go.

Someone actually did the math and if you weren't a half-orc (extra die on crits) champion fighter(crit on 19 or 20) barbarian (extra dice on crits AND basically permanent advantage) multi class using a d12 weapon, the feat is mathematically worse then just taking the +2 to strength. And even in _this_ build, it doesn't actually start helping until at least lvl 8. AND and, this is just going fighter for the crit range, rest barb for more crit dice, which is just worse just getting advantage and subclass from barbarian with the rest fighter because it gets more attacks instead of more dice.\n\nGranted, you're not giving up +2 str here, so it might actually be okay, but _man,_ that opportunity cost hurts in 5e."", ""On the subject of die rerolls (specifically regarding the feats Healer and Savage Attacker), I get why it feels like they're super powerful (and they definitely have those moments where they feel amazing like rolling a 1 and a 11 on a d12), but on average they're usually not that good unless the die is really swingy (like the d20) or have a major consequence for rolling super low (also like the d20). There's gonna be a bit of math involved, but this is a PF community, so it shouldn't be too bad.\n\nHealer:\nHealing magic for the most part isn't super great in 5e, because replenishing health in between fights is relatively easy. Healing Word and Goodberry are generally considered to be the best healing spells. In the case of the former, it's a good way to get someone back up with a bonus action, and the latter because of some kind of cheesy (and somewhat dubious) usages. Since the latter doesn't use dice, I'll calculate the gain for Healing Word. \nOn average assuming a +4 casting mod, Healing Word does 6.5 points of healing in a first level slot. With the feat, the average is 6.875 points of healing for a gain of 0.375. The percent increase of this being 5.76923%. Upcasting this to 9th level (which you would not normally do), you go from 26.5 to 29.875 for a gain of 3.375 (percent increase 12.7358%). At that level, that's a pretty inconsequential gain.\nFor the absolute most healing gained from the feat, the spell to use is Mass Cure Wounds. You would need 6 relevant targets for this to be matter, but it's certainly possible. The spell is 5th level, so on slot under the same assumptions, the average goes from 117 to 124.875 for a gain of 7.875 and a percentage increase of 6.73077%. For perspective, spending that feat to increase your casting stat would increase the healing by 6, and that does a bunch of other things too. If upcast to 9th level, the healing goes from 225 to 243.375 for a gain of 18.375 and a percentage increase of 8.16667$. You would never do this upcast as Mass Heal heals a flat 700 divided amongst any number of creatures in range.\nOverall, some moderate gains at higher levels, but healing is really worth focusing on in this game and increasing your ability score is pretty much always better, and thus not worth the feat investment.\n\nSavage Attacker:\nThis one has a bit more significant of a gain, at low levels, but scales horribly. While you do have the situations described at 1:28:28, you have just as many where there is little to no difference. When evaluating the power of something like this, you have to look at how it performs on average. \nAssuming a d12 damage die (as that is the highest weapon damage die in the game) and a +3 STR mod, without the feat, you deal 9.5 damage on average on a hit. With the feat, you deal 11.4861 damage on average on a hit for a damage gain of 1.9861 (+18.9278%). While a respectable gain at low levels, this quickly looses value at 5th level (where you get an extra attack), and continues dropping off after. If you're a Fighter, this loses value even at low levels as you won't benefit from it when Action Surging. Considering increasing STR not only gives you more than half this damage gain, and increases your chance to hit by 5% on all attacks, the STR bump is a significantly better investment.\nIt definitely has it's moments, but it's not great on average. That's not to say you shouldn't take it. It definitely feels awesome in those moments where it drastically flips a result. That cant be worth it on its own. Just don't take it expecting your character to become significantly more powerful, because they won't.\n\nIf you read the whole thing, thanks for doing so. I'm not trying to rain on anyone's parade.

But other than the Battle Master archetype, I must say that I have to point out that the Fighter in Pathfinder is a better option. Because, unlike D&D where the flavor of the character lends itself almost solely on the class. The Fighter's flavor comes from more than just the class. The race, the background, even where they come from within the world. Each aspect builds upon the fighter's theme. Sure they may take Power Attack at first level, but what led them to that choice, where they a whirling dervish from the sands of Qadira or do they hail from the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. If they are an archer, did they grow up in Nirmathas as the offspring of one of the famed rangers, or where they just a spoiled royal heir who thought archery was cool. No matter how the dice are rolled, the pathfinder fighter is just more than just the class. Or was he one of the Knights of Lastwall. \n\nDon't get me wrong, Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, even Eberron and Dark Sun are incredible worlds. Each has their elements that build toward a great character. But they don't fuel flavor nearly as much. And Exandria become an incredible world to set the adventures into, but the downside is that the worlds don't add as much flavor to the classes. You either buy your ability points or you roll four d6's and drop the lowest. When you add your race, this can either hurt or boost the character in order to play a certain class. That system I think more than anything is what is makes the Fighter weaker than the one in Pathfinder. \n\nTo sum up, in D&D you play a class and race, and where you come from in the world is nearly an afterthought.

They could even get two feats and have the attribute at 20 if they put a +2 into the attribute and grabbed a half feat that gave it a +1.

However: that's like 5 minutes. Then, you are given a choice: take the crossbow to fight Deskari or run for it. You take the crossbow and then complain that your character fights Deskari. Anyhow, let's talk about the tutorial dungeon: your character might be a jerk, but why would Seelah not team up with you? You're in the middle of a demon invasion and trapped underground. You basically complain that Seelah is not the kind of Paladin you hate playing with. She's pragmatic enough to team up with you for the greater good - at least for now.\n\nAs for the early fights: the enemies are the rat in the cellar version of that adventure path. I do say that there are too many of them and recommend not playing in turn based for such simplistic fights.\n\nOkay, the angel mythic path: you have a vision and obtain the sword on an Angel. There are reasons why your character is highly compatible with all sorts of mythic paths that also play in the fact that you basically arrive at the Kanabres market square without a hint of what is going on or even where you are.\n\nThen, when you complain that you don't make any meaningful choices, you tell us you decided to hide that you have the angelic power and abandon the tribe of Mongrels. That sure is a choice - and not one that is necessarily evil. Wenduag makes one good point: the Mongrels are not all fighters and they are relatively save underground. Choosing not to lead them into a maze of Baphomet cultists so they can join a war against a demon lord may not be the choice a Paladin would take due to the dishonesty of it, but it is not a reason to flip the table and stay trapped underground while a demon invasion is underway. Also: the choice you make does exactly what you want it to do: it pushes a party member away as a consequence of your actions. \n\nIf you don't want to have Seelah around, you can kick her out as soon as the tutorial ends. As for her motivation: the story is structured in a way that she can only really participate in the crusade if she sticks with you. The poor girl just wants to fight demons. It is possible to push her away, but in my opinion, it does come too late. \n\nAlso: when your character just refuses to cooperate with Paladins, why did they join the crusaders? It's like complaining that your character is railroaded into accepting to become ruler of the stolen lands after defeating the stag lord. Maybe my Azata rogue would rather travel to Galt and save people from the judgment of the grey guardians instead of managing a barony.

Also, reading the Setting\'s lore is a plus if you want to get covered. For exemple, i\'m currently reading the ""Descent into Avernus"" (NO SPOILERS) campaign situated on Baldur\'s Gate, i thought it was great... as a novel. nice to read it along the story until the possible endings, but it was a bit too flowery (is it the right term? idk) for me. but then i got into the Baldur\'s Gate section of the book, with all those place and such, it is really great to build an adventure, and even more with related material (Murder in Baldur\'s Gate? anyone?).\nWhat I am trying to say is that those adventure path aren\'t just adventure path, they can be building blocks to a fantastic adventure.\n\nAlso, about the Social Contract, ask your player what they would like to play, then get the material (or Vice Versa,, depends on the group) and THEN you tell them the premise even before they make their characters and you ask them to make adapted characters to the adventure (ex: this adventure will be investigation and political with machiavelian plots) so that they know that if they go along with ""*Grognac the baby eater, monster breeder*"" they might not have the fun they think.\n\n\nanyway, great video, this puts a nice perspective on the ""I don\'t like PRE"" side of the conversation. \n\none last thing, social contract is NOT to be unspoken, you NEED to talk about the contract with every member of the group, even newbies or veterans, every times (and i mean every campaign startups and wite it down in the discord, if there is). Either as a reminder, or a heads up. ""Please, I know you want to play *Grognac, baby eater, monster breeder* but i don\'t want this adventure to drag on the *capturing monsters and breeding them* side, i wanted to try this adventure path so could you follow it?

Things we have done to make this more interesting is supplement in various scenarios for ""extra loot"" and play things what we never would truly consider. For example, my party all wanted to play as goblins, so we played all of the ""We Be Goblins"" along with the adventure path including the ""Fangwood Keep"" module for the party to have their own command fortress for their army, ""Conquest of Bloodsworn Vale"" for army reinforcements and acquire a magical tactical nuke, and ""Clash of the Kingslayers""for the Dwarven aspect of it. We were even considering adding in ""The Moonscar"" module to go along with Ironfang Invasion\'s book 5 but at this point, most of our original party members are no longer playing. \n\nTo be honest, i feel that adventure paths can be long-winded, especially with players who are used to short adventures and scenarios like that of Pathfinder Society. However, what adventure paths does offer you is FREEDOM to adjust the story how you see fit, used unsanctioned races and classes, and find new ways to have fun. I have skipped fights that were only placed for XP and try to stick to the plot if possible. At this point, I have grown tired of playing the adventure path ""Giantslayer"" and running ""Ironfang Invasion"". At this point, I have heard that running and adventure path can be tedious, It maybe be better to just run it as guide links of the adventure and not follow it word for word.']"

There is a correlation with the DM describing the outcome when done in order, but it's not impossible for the DM to simply send it back after the DC is resolved and give the player the opportunity to Roleplay. \n\nFundamentally, roleplaying before checking DC is biased, nearly cheating. Preroll roleplayers naturally bias toward assumed success, which is why you have DC result conflicts when the player assumed a success where a role was appropriate. A good roleplayer can roleplay, and enjoy, the success or failure their character's performance outcome. \n\nIt might sound strange, but that's the most accurate interaction of the rules.

The sound of hail or a thunder storm discouraging a gang  to go outside their door. It can be used to signal your camp that a meal is ready (triangle ringing anyone?) In a chase scenario it could produce the sound of boots running in a different direction. Want to intimidate? Rush toward the target with a jump cord or a high pitched wail. And while it cannot produce articulated sounds, there's enough here (with DM's permission) to emulate the cadence, tone, and rhythm of a person's speech -- all things that are good enough to be a distraction to the inattentive. \n\nPlus you can lull yourself to sleep with the roar of a crashing ocean, and who wouldn't want to sleep to that?

I have heard of this game called dungeons and dragons...', 'I *love your videos* and this one is no exception though I do *look at things a bit different* from yourself.  I will begin with a minor issue with your side by side book comparison.  In truth, Pathfinder\'s Core Rulebooks have been a combination of the TWO core AD&D/D&D Rulebooks (i.e., Dungeon Master\'s Guide & Player\'s Handbook) each about 300+ pages which is fairly comparable. I do understand what you were trying to demonstrate with simple versus more complex; however, the visual aid is not an honest, and thereby *not* a good, comparison and should have been omitted from this video (but it was 9:00am).\n\nWith regard to D&D comparisons, I would say you are going to have to deal with this for a long time (decades) because D&D is the comparison most folks know and will be for sometime due to how popularity scales. I do think that \'clone\' is the wrong word and would recommend a different word and will leave that to others to sort out, but I mean something like ""D&D variation"" or D&D derivative"" or more accurately ""D&D = Progenitor"" so others would be ""D&D Descendant"" only because I believe D&D grew out of table-top war gamers boredom while waiting their turned with large scale battle table-top battles and started with simple rules for individual character arena-styles - usually between the generals and leaders of the larger forces - and developed from that point.  Gary Gygax & David Arneson were just one of the first to codify rules and put them into an entirely separate playable system (e.g., Blackmoor & Dungeons & Dragons circa 1974) and they really lead the way in this regard for a long time from rules to character sheets.  I joined the circle of players just as they were transitioning from original softcovers to DMG & PH 1st Edition Hardcovers) a few years later.  It\'s not to say other systems did not exist or compete, Arduin (circa 1978) by Hargrave, was a brilliant variation and there were many others... I own a fair number. As points of reference, Traveler RPG (circa 1978), Call of Cthulhu (Circa 1981), Judges Guild (1978), Tunnels & Trolls (1975), Boot Hill (1975)... of those I know, really only  Empire of the Petal Throne (circa 1974 > TSR 1975) was parallel and within a year TSR had acquired it.\n\nAs to Pathfinder, itself is a direct descent, and I remember it well.  After years of after school junior/high-school play, I was involved in a long-running AD&D 2nd Edition (every 2-weeks 12n to 10:00pm w/1.5-2 hr dinner break with adult gamers in a single long running campaign as a sophomore in college I was the youngest player by far - I played 15-yrs and they had been running about 10-yrs before I played and mostly all playing the same characters they started with - yes, XP was harder to get, magic items did not drip from trees, and so on).  While Dragon Magazine was originally TSR, I believe the ownership was something like this - TSR > WoC > Paizo > WoC > cessation). So, Pathfinder was the unborn egg of a Dragon (i.e., Dragon Magazine which was 95% AD&D Based). \n\nWith Wizards of the Coast (Hasbro) acquisition of TSR (due to piss-poor management), AD&D (2E was moving into Unearthed Arcana, and expanding through softcover guides and heading to 3.0) players fear what was to come and it did, Wizards of the Coast warped the game, IMHO, in to a watered down variation and over-simplified the rules and tried to balance every class by nerfing abilities rather than experience point variation by class.  While many of us felt like some of the changes were sorely needed, I thought others were as unnecessary as \'not keeping score\' and \'everyone gets a trophy\' which is fine for Pre-K & K kids sports maybe... but for goodness sake this is a game for teens and adults.  Most of us got, Mage 9th was more like a Fighter 11 and Thief 12 and dual and multiclass characters were an average on -1 level lower and that 1 character can do only so much in a round so.... multiclass offered depth of options without impacting actual round to round battle as much as some assumed.\n\nAnyway, I am ranting a bit now.  I will love Paizo \'til the day I die for rescuing AD&D from the trash-bin of D&D 4E and even 5E with PF 1E.  I thought (MHO) that it was a great mix of the original plus some much needed updates though I did not love level caps and the absence of multi-classing and was semi-okay with every class on the same experience point totals for easy of play. Even so, I think most of our long-term players I played with (adult game) that it was a great system though the loss of depth in our party - multi-class to single class - level caps evening of all character classes - was too much of a risk.  If we were just starting our campaign (not decades into it), I think we would have gone with Pathfinder.\n\nSo, I will come back from my drifting rant to the main topic before ending with something more about PF-2E. I would say that the word you are looking for is ""D&D Descendant"" because it is probably the most accurate and continues to use the term of familiarity to the uninitiated (your parents) so they will understand.  It\'s a stretch for most people to go from D&D Clone to TTRPG, but the transition from D&D Clone to D&D Descendant you can probably change in a 4-10 years if you could get the community to agree.\n\nWith regard to my final thoughts, I do like PF-2E though I regard PF-1E as the master game whose main mistake was getting to far into the weeds with rule and campaign variations which lead to an over complicated combat round even AD&D 2-3.5 was not that complicated (reactions should have been simplified and limited).  It was a perfect counter to the mess of AD&D 4E.  So, I also see the reason that PF 2E came about with AD&D 5E and popularity of Critical Role as PF 1E had made itself overly complex (much as AD&D 3+ E).  What I really dislike about it is what some like a lot about it.  I really hate the proficiency by level because it scales (IMHO) way too much and requires magic items to drip from trees or symbiotically grow with characters and really gets into what we called Monty Hall D&D (for us old gamers not a good term) and the bloat of Ability Point Advancements.\n\nIf I had been advising Paizo, I would have recommended going with Non-Proficiency Level (Variation) with Proficiency by Level (as Variation not Core) and toned the ability score advancement arc down (maybe +1 to 2 abilities scaling to +1 to 4 abilities as folks level). Personally, I prefer the worlds where magic, magic items, and incredible wealth were rare and hard fought victories were needed to claim even some of these things.  What I do like about PF 2E is almost everything else - backgrounds, ancestries, heritages, and I could go on and on - even the 3-action system for melee rounds.  I could go on... but really I think you depth of mastery with the system does not require it and you get my point.\n\nBefore anyone says anything stupid, I say this all IMHO as requested in this and all videos on this channel... so viewers feel free to leave your thoughts, please don\'t take offense, attack, or think I am slamming the video. What I wrote is \'just a thought\' - hope you have a great day.', 'D&D is a decent Tolkien clone though...']"

Then, you stop Guessing spells per day, you PREPARE them.\nThis fits into the fantasy of someone careful and who plans ahead.\nAnd on the other hand, you get spontainous spell casters.

They use limited area of magic, but thanks to narrow field, they are able to use their entire repertoire (pun both intended and not), just as the situation arises. They are your fire cultist, who after dealing with elementals learns few fire spells. It\'s the child that was born during a storm, that started to show supernatural storm themed abilities.

Never played a sorc, when I just could be bard or wizard.\n\nPF 2e meanwhile does make the difference. And it is also informing the way character interacts with the world. The sorcerer can head in anywhere, knowing it\'s spells are as good as they always are, because they don\'t change. If the situations don\'t work for them, it\'s same as fighter fighting someone with very high AC, or rogue fighting someone with precision immunity.\nWizards on the other hand are witcher like in their approach to adventuring.

Initially the reaction from some players from other tables pointed the finger at the DM we’d been given as not playing the scenario correctly or that he’d been too soft. After discussing our game and comparing it to theirs it was clear it was not our DM’s fault at all but the approach of the others group of players.

When I asked did you use any immobilising effects or trip or anything to affect it’s mobility to be able to touch you they said no we just hit it with our optimal attacks.

Our GM wants to see our characters win, that doesn’t mean our characters never die, they do, and it also sometimes means that she changes some encounters to make them harder, our last dnd campaign she changed the final big boss to make the encounter harder because she felt it would be too easy for us, we only just survived, but the combat would’ve been boring the way it was originally written', 'Pathfinder 2e isnt at fault for having Players with lack of Imagination like in Cody´s Rant...how to be bad in a roleplay game?

I, for one, know that I focused on being the very best at my role in my builds for years. When I realized that I should focus on making a literary character I would enjoy reading in a book, my ability to enjoy TTRPGs vastly improved, and I was better positioned to enable my fellow players to have even more amazing moments of creative synergy.\n\nMy personal takeaway from this kind of thing is, play flawed characters. Don\'t be perfectly built. Have negatives in more than one stat. Use the poor stats when making a check and play the failures through to fruition, because roleplaying failures is a blast. Learning to describe success and the PLETHORA of failures that life subjects you to is an important lesson.

The way you describe the granted spells, for example from the Undead bloodline, made it sound like the 1st level granted spell replaced one of their choices, rather than being an extra spell added to the spells the get to choose from (which they get to choose 2 spells, so Fear would be added to their repertoire as a third 1st level spell).

So it’s better just not to hide/take cover overall\n>if you can’t shoot from cover, cover rules makes no sense apart from lesser cover and increasing cover degree. If you can the explanation makes no sense cuz it means normal/natural greater cover by default gives you +4 AC from being behind a wall and out of line of sight from an enemy that can still shoot an arrow at you through that wall.

After all since bonuses don't stack and you only get Circumstance and Status effects you simply pick the best of each. \n\nAs an example encounter say someone is Clumsy 2, Frighten 1, Sicken 1, and Enfeebled 1 First you'd ask WTH happen to them but next you simple got to the highest number first Clumsy 2 gives Dex based checks like AC so they get a -2 Status penalties to AC and you don't have to even bother with the others since status penalties don't stack. And a quick search of their page shows the ONLY circumstance penalties to ANYTHING is Flat-Footed -2 to armor. Thus EVERY OTHER Condition penalty will simply take the highest one. Not complicated math at all.\n\nThe same is true of buffs as most spells like Bless/Guidance/etc give + status bonus of which you just take the highest. And in most cases it doesn't matter all that much like in Puffins case was a 32 vs 33 gonna mean the difference between a crit/hit/miss? if not then just move on as that's what we do in our games when someone might be unsure of bonus total, like oh wait that 32 is suppose to be a 33, well you need a 35 to hit so you still miss. Or like the same with crit except well you only needed 28 to hit and not even close to +10 for crit so roll damage and lets go. Most of the time ball parking it is close enough. It's only if your are right on the edge you wanna be 100% sure you got every point. \n\nActually I think someone should do a video on this sort of thing because all I ever see is a lot of PF 2E is too complicated because conditions VS PF 2E is very approachable system that's not complicated. The one side like Puffin misrepresent things and the defenders just use an appeal to authority of Don't listen to that guy listen to me it's not hard."", ""Yeah talismans are pretty weak for their cost.

And like with that Potency Crystal it last a single turn so after about 25 rounds of using a stack of them you could have just bought a permanent magical weapon. It would make more sense if it was something like it lasted for a full day, or at least a full encounter (1-10 minutes). The use once per day like he suggest I think makes them feel to much like wands and also would just fit better as normal property runes you get. \n\nThe Talisman Dabbler class at first glance looks like it might be the alchemist of Talismans making them for free each day. But the archetype is completely a worthless waist of space. You only get TWO free talismans per day and they are HALF your level. You can spend another feat increase that to FOUR Talismans a day but given how weak they are for their own level having ones at half your level is pretty worthless."", ""Having been watching Puffin's channel for a while, I'm pretty sure he's either being purposefully confusing for funsies, or he's just not good at adding bonuses.\nI'd love to see him deal with AD&D THAC0 :P"", '3:11 He never played 2e D&D did he!

Always appreciate your thoughts on these. I wanted to add a little to four of the cantrips. \r\n\r\nDisrupt Undead - One thing to note is that many of the creatures that would be hurt by this, will have resistances to other forms of damage. This can also be used to detect with a creature is undead - but if it's not then you've just attacked someone. It scales nicely too.\r\n\r\nDivine Lance - This doesn't deal damage to creatures unless they have the opposite alignment. You can't hurt neutral creatures at all.\r\nBecause of this, just like disrupt undead, you can use this as a basic detect spell for opposing alignments if you're willing to attack someone. Riskier than Disrupt Undead, because an NPC might be evil but not an antagonist - just not a very good person. Again, it bypasses most resistances and many creatures do have this as a weakness, as you've said. Weakness doesn't double the damage though, if a creature has Weakness 3 then it'll do an extra 3 damage, Weakness 1 would do one more damage.\r\n\r\nForbidding Ward - As a cantrip it's useful and surprisingly strong if you can spare the action to sustain it. Divine Aura is a Level 8 spell and it still only grants a +1 Status to AC. In fact only this and lay on hands can grant a +2 to AC. You can cast it once, then sustain and cast it on a second ally, if you're able to spend to actions to sustain them each round.\r\n\r\nGuidance - it's one action only, which is huge. For a support player, especially at early levels, it's almost your go to spell. +1 can be significant with the new crit rules, and this spell demonstrates that by regularly turning that hit into a crit.

I also don\'t think that alignment is really anything that interests most players of it anyway.\n\nThe only reason why alignment creates so many problems is because, in modern games, alignment has shifted into a character\'s personality and morality from what it actually was... a character\'s alignment or allegiance with a particular cosmic force not dissimilar to a kind of meta-faction. Maybe it wasn\'t always interpreted in the same way as this kind of meta-faction by the earliest players of D&D, but it solves so many problems, and honestly the inclusion of the good-evil axis in AD&D just caused this inevitable shift towards confusion.\n\nWith this meta-factional understanding of alignment, that you\'re siding with certain cosmic forces, everything just makes sense, at least to me. Champions and clerics are required to follow the same cosmic force as their deity, the powers of Law and Chaos can harm one another because they\'re opposing forces, and neutral creatures don\'t fall on either side and are thus unaffected.\n\nThis is a side point, but I don\'t have a problem with true neutral characters being immune to alignment damage, but I\'ve always liked my games to be more on the simulationist side of things so that makes perfect sense to me. Maybe in pathfinder, like someone else has said, they can take half damage to all alignment damage; that way they take less damage in each instance, but they\'ll take overall more damage  because they\'re affected by everything. Maybe everything else can also take half damage from alignment sources that they\'re not opposed to, and while that does keep true neutral characters ""the best,"" or whatever, it won\'t be by nearly as much... probably close to half as much, I\'d think.', 'Edict: like vids on YT', 'I disagree.

Extreme Order promotes strict hierarchies and social expectations... while Extreme Chaos promotes freedom from hierarchies and social expectations. The two would be in constant battle... with mere mortals trapped in between.\n\nGo through Gods and Magic... look at how much the Chaos gods care about freedom, about choice. Sure, this isn\'t perfect, because Chaotic Evil (Demons) want to have freedom to do whatever they want and don\'t really care about the choices, or lack thereof, they force onto others. To put it in another way they represent ""I can do anything I want for my enjoyment. I don\'t care about others, except when I can use them for my own purposes.""\n\nMost humans are in between the Order and Chaos dichotomy. As humans _are_ social animals, we strive to come up with rules on how to fit in with a group... so we have better group cohesion. This is reflected in our games. How many people have played Calvin Ball in their lives? Contrast that number with the number of people who played games with rules, lol.\n\nAs for the Evil - Good Axis, it\'s Selfless vs Selfish. Fiends represent the extreme selfishness, where their wellbeing is placed way higher than the wellbeing of others. Celestials represent the extreme in selflessness, where the wellbeing of others is placed way higher than their personal wellbeing.\n\n\nAll gods, and all outsiders, _are_ individuals. They all have their likes, dislikes, and personal goals, which flavour how they interact with the Selfless-Selfish and Authoritarian-Libertarian axis. Having a base definition of each point on the grid, in the form of edicts and anathemas would be helpful... instead of leaving everything up to the players/DM to decide what\'s ""good, evil, lawful, chaos""... as each person\'s idea of all 4 _would_ be different.\n\nThis is, in part, what pissed me off when Dungeon Craft made his video ""All Clerics are Lawful""... He is _too_ full of Order to really understand how Chaos can operate. Especially when his arguments are riddled with fallacies, non-sequiturs, and he ignores reality. It does explain his use of the Argument from Authority fallacy, ROFL.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Paizo didn\'t really think of using Edicts/Anathemas to describe the alignments, instead they used some vague descriptions... but reserved the more extreme edicts for the Champion. If they are doing away with Alignment altogether... that might cause some problems... because the _outsiders_ represent the closest approximation of Perfect Selfishness, Perfect Selflessness, Perfect Authoritarianism, Perfect Libertarianism... and variations of that.\n\nYes... this leads to the biggest issue of their removal Neutrals would be strictly ""I see some merit between the two extremes so I pick which is best for the current situation"" or ""I see the extremes as dangerous, and more moderate approach is best""... causes Neutral Alignments to require more complex explanations, or fewer edicts and anathemas. *shakes head*\n\nAs I said, a base ""definition"" which is modified by the entity in question would be best for games where alignments matter... and they do matter to gods capable of destroying entire cities devoted to them, when the gods realize the citizens have strayed too far from the gods\' morals and ethics. I\'m referring to the time Sarenrae\'s followers built a city on a misunderstanding of her words... and refused to leave the city they built after multiple warnings...

Which is roughly the same or better than 1 size bigger Fatal die.\n\nAnd the alternate crafting rules are getting a bad rap from knee jerk reactions. You can't even afford to make on-level magic items in the current rules (seriously look at their price and compare to treasure by level) and the extra time on permanents is probably to accommodate for the fact the book has rules to make crafting more affordable at the cost of time. With all the variant rules in play it's actually way, way more plausible to afford crafting. Especially the item ranges that are already plausible, which are also much easier to speed up (items 2 levels lower than you).\n\nAnd people are reacting to the DC of crafting something on-level at max speed and balking, but really if you're going to craft the highest level thing you can craft and try to craft it as fast as you possibly can... shouldn't that be pretty hard? Note that if you use Treat Wounds and immediately jack up the DC when you hit Master it's not super reliable. Not maxing the speed boost of on level items makes it far easier and lower level items are far easier to both afford to make and make quickly. And those are the majority of the things you will be crafting in practice."", ""Ah the poor crafting system. Good thing I can't see that fuckup over the planet sized pile of cool bullshit.""]"

Thank you!  However, I disagree with your opinion...at least through the earlier levels. Many of the low-level spells just feel so weak now. Damaging spells do the same as earlier editions, which weren't broken. However, everything has a lot more health, and martials deal more damage. So they feel a bit behind. Unlike martials, casters only have so many higher slots per day. And as you point out, doing damage spells under your highest levels is not a great use of action economy. Lower-level crowd control spells and the such have been nerfed into near uselessness. Using paralyze (third level) to essentially take away 1-3 actions of a same-level enemy or lower (due to incapacitation) hardly seems like a good use of action economy. Slow (third level) takes two of your actions to have a chance of reducing enemy actions by 1. Unless the enemy lasts 3 or more rounds, you come out behind on that deal, even if it sticks. And generally speaking, the third action is the least valuable. \n\nThings do ramp up big time as you get into mass versions of things like fear, slow, paralyze, etc, as well as better AOE attacks. But telling a class that they have to wait that long to become fun is not really exciting for most players. It's an old school design that I'm surprised to see anymore. A fighter (and most martials) feel awesome right from level 1 onwards. \n\nTheory crafting aside, my opinion comes from watching and listening to players running 5 PF2e games. Furthermore, it also comes from DM'ing monsters.  I have killed many more players with fighter and fighter like monsters than casters... at least until level 9ish.  A group of level 4 casters is no threat to any of my players. But four fighters or even rogues? Watch out!\n\nAs a DM, the way I usually address these low-level blues is by 'dropping' a few higher-than-normal wands so casters can truly be awesome 1-3 times/day, truly impacting a battle in a large way. Giving a 3rd level wizard a wand of fireball or a 6th level wizard a heighten slow wand can give them a taste of things to come and help get them more excited."", ""I actually disagree to an extent on this one. \n\nAt low levels in particular, it's hard to make an effective blaster caster. \n\nFor example, at first level you can prepare one of your two leveled slots per day with burning hands which may only wind up targeting one or two enemies due to encounter design or avoiding hitting your allies with your spell's geometry. The spell does 2d6 fire damage to each effective creature, half on a save and nothing on a crit success. Ergo you can safely assume that the spell will probably deal 6 points of fire damage or so, assuming you hit two, roll low and one creature saves. \n\nCompare that to casting magic weapon on your allied fighter's weapon (we'll say it's a d10 weapon with reach): for 10 rounds, the fighter deals an extra dice of damage and has a +1 to their hit and crit chance. We'll say your fighter misses 4 hits and crits twice attacking once a turn and never getting attack of opportunity to proc. The 4 normal hits will average out to 20 additional damage and the crits should add an additional 10 each. That's 40 damage, just under 7 times the effectiveness of blasting. \n\nAnd I'm being extremely generous with my math here. It's likely combat won't last 10 turns, but that +1 striking will add more damage than 40 in that shorter time period."", ""Everyone talks about balance as in damage. My issue is the complete lack of flexibility in the casting. Having to anticipate just which utility spells I'll need or waste the slot sucks. Using a higher level slot to upcast is cool, hell, the gimp damage on cantrips is even fine. but having so few spells, and then having to decide before I even start the day I need to decide if i think I might fall. Do I prepare featherfall, then just waste that slot if no one falls? Or do I just go full blaster because I know I'll use them then just laugh as a party member falls to their death. I don't care about the balance of damage, I care about having fun and feeling like my magical being can use magic to solve problems without fear of wasting my very few slots."", 'Sounds like you play martials', ""I I've come over from 5e (where I got disillusioned around a year ago),  looked into 2e around November blessedly, so I have the books!"", ""there are still issues in this system though : \nYou can have encounters, especially on odd levels, where even mook monsters are at your level+1, rendering any incapacitation spells you have prepared useless. This is especially annoying considering you have to commit your highest-level spells slots to those spells for them to be useful at all meaning it's those slots that become useless.\nAoE blast damage do not scale remotely as well as hp. Ideally those spells should a least put mook hp low enough for them to be taken out with one more hit, especially if they use your highest level slots. They clearly do not do that. \nbuffs and debuffs do not feel good to use. Fear is regarded as one of the best debuffs in the game and it generally give a malus that last 2 turns on a normal failure. Pretty much all debuffs are like that. At least give it a minute duration.\nAnd i don't care how a +1 is supposed to be big in 2e. Sure it's bigger than an equivalent +1 in 1e, but not THAT big. It's about the equivalent of a +2 in 1e, which while nice isn't much. And that's numerical bonuses. the cooler debuffs like blinded conditions or slowed are now worth the incapacitation tag, or need to be upcasted to super high levels to affect more than one target. \nSame for buffs. Rare are the buffs that last more than one minute and in general it's utility stuff like water breathing. And unless upcasted to super high levels they tend to be single target. We can't pre-buff before a fight now. Also non-standard buffs like protection from evil granting immunity against mind-affecting spells, or death ward preventing negative and preventing 1 fatal blow are gone too. Now all is made of puny numerical bonuses. Part of what made caster fun is the ability to prepare for a fight, and that ability is now crippled.""]"

Otherwise you will get schooled by some encounters."", 'I love PF2e, but this video has a very common mystake: a +1 does not give you a +5% chance to hit AND a +5% chance to crit. It gives you a +5% chance to hit OR a +5% chance to crit.\n\nLet me explain: there are many possibilities when you roll the dice. I will not count the cases where a nat 20 misses the DC or AC and the cases where rolling a nat 1 still hits the DC or AC because you should not really be in these situations at all. These are cinematographic moments to show how cool the PCs have become or how serious the threat of the BBEG is.\n\nThat being said I will divide the rest in three categories. The first one is when you need a 10 or an 11 on your dice to hit the DC or AC.\n\nWhy am I making this into it\'s own category? Because the +/-10 rule does not apply to these cases.  In both these cases, you can ONLY crit fail on a nat one and ONLY crit success on a nat 20. Do the math yourself if you don\'t believe me.\n\nThen the other two categories are if you need more then an 11 or less then a 10 to succeed.\n\nSo let\'s take an ""easy"" example: you need an 8 on your d20 to succeed!\nChance to crit fail: 5% (nat 1 only)\nChance to fail: 30% (2 to 7)\nChance to succeed: 50% (8 to 17)\nChance to crit succeed: 15% (18 to 20)\n\nNow give me a +1!! Cool!! Now I need a seven to succeed!\n\nChance to crit fail: 5% (nat 1)\nChance to fail: 25% (2 to 6)\nChance to succeed: 50% (7 to 16)\nChance to crit succeed: 20% (17 to 20)\n\nMy chance to succeed has stayed exactly the same. 50%. But my chance to fail was reduced by 5% in favor of a chance to crit succeed.\n\nLet\'s take the ""hard"" example: you need 13 on your d20 to hit the AC:\n\nChance to crit fail: 15% (1 to 3)\nChance to fail: 45% (4 to 12)\nChance to succeed: 35% (13 to 19)\nChance to crit success: 5% (nat 20)\n\nNow give me my +1 I now need a 12:\n\nChance to crit fail: 10% (1 or 2)\nChance to fail: 45% (3 to 11)\nChance to succeed: 40% (12 to 19)\nChance to crit succeed: 5% (nat 20)\n\nNow my chance to succeed did go up by 5%, but not my chance to crit succeed. Like I said, it\'s one or the other.\n\nWhat about the cases where you need a 10?\n\nCanche to crit fail: 5% (nat 1)\nChance to fail: 40% (2 to 9)\nChance to succeed: 50% (10 to 19)\nChance to crit succeed: 5% (nat 20)\n\nNow give me my +1:\n\nChance to crit fail: 5% (nat 1)\nChance to fail: 35% (2 to 8)\nChance to succeed: 50% (9 to 18)\nChance to crit succeed: 10% (19 or 20)\n\nAgain, a +1 NEVER gets you both a +5% to hit AND a +5% to crit, it\'s one or the other.', 'Your hellhound example.... yeah, I may have done something like that in the past.

While it can feel smart the first couple of times, it gets old VERY fast.\n\nRogue are supposed to play and fight smart, but Ho gosh did it felt absolutely NOT that, it felt like the dumbest thing ever.\n\nMaybe it\'s because my GM didn\'t like knowledge checks being used as free action, or homebrewing the use of skills in combat (because intimidation would do what ? Gives foes disadvantages ? That felt too strong, and in the end, it would probably cost the standard action, so not worth it as a rogue), because WOTC decided that skills in fight shouldn\'t be supported outside of stealth or athletics, basically.\n\nThat\'s part of why I so love the 3 action system of PF2E, and the far more robust skill system: Fights are feel far more varied and you\'re advised and rewarded for doing other stuff than just ""I\'mma just hit stuff"".\nHell, it\'s probably even mandatory if you want to actually fight bosses.\n\nIn the end, I play a bard in 5E now, and that feels a little bit less braindead (thank inspiration and spellcasting), but it still feels too basic if you don\'t have your class have a built-in support for acting tactically.']"

I agree it needed to be nerfed, but when so few players opt to take it (my experiences seem to mirror yours here) then I think it’s an indication maybe it got hit too hard.  People are quick to point to worthy summons like the Skunk, and I agree such capable creatures exist.  But usually it’s just going to be one or two options every couple levels that not only stand out, but are actually worth the action and resource trade off.  And that just…feels bad.  When I ask players why they don’t take Summoning spells, the answer is often a variation of the same, “because it’s not really fun using the same four creatures all the time” theme. \n\nThe problem I have is I’m not exactly certain what the solution here could be.  I agree a better scaling balance, but then you run the risk of reverting to 1e overpowering problems.  I agree a Summons shouldn’t be as strong as a fellow PC, or even as strong as an Animal Companion (before the latter falls off a cliff at higher levels).  \n\nI think the answer might be in either offering the caster something more for themself just for summoning the creature, or some additional boon for the creature.  Perhaps summoning Fey gives the caster a +1 Circumstance bonus against magical effects.  Alternatively, perhaps the creature summoned receives that bonus instead.  Perhaps Summon Plant and Fungus offers the caster a bump in AC, or, again, offers it to the creature for a better shot at survival past one round.  I’m just spitballing here, so don’t hold me on those as being balanced yay or nay.  \n\nMy other suggestion is to create an Archetype where a player can spend resources to upgrade their Summons.  There are already several Feats spread around the different classes that offer forms of upgrade to their summoned creatures.  But an Archetype could gather them all together, and add some additional upgrade options, and allow for a player to fortify or supercharge any creature it summons.  Similar to the Beastmaster Archetype, this could be perfectly usable by any spellcaster class playing under normal rules.  But it could also be slightly more powerful than other Archetypes when using the Free Archetype Rules, as so many GMs do.  And honestly, I think that’s fine.  If a player wants to spend their precious Archetype Feats upgrading their Summons, they should be allowed.  Because otherwise, I’m not exactly sure, as written, there’s a good balance to be had.  Summoning definitely isn’t overpowered in 2e, but it’s lost much of the fun flavor, at least in my eyes and those of my players.  \n\nI’m interested in hearing more of your thoughts on Summoning.  It’s a topic that many people feel strongly about, and one I see discussed online and hear talked about at my table.

I get the feeling that many DMs don’t really utilize the mechanics of knowledge, or even emphasize to their players how important they can be.  \n\nFor example, I’ve had players share with me that they’ve been in other campaigns where in-combat Knowledge-based feats, like the Bard’s Combat Reading, the Bard/Thaumaturge’s Know-It-All, and even the Investigator’s Known Weaknesses feat had little impact for them because the DM was so worried about giving away info (usually in fear of making combats too easy).  \n\nI had one player tell me she thought the 1st-level Investigator feat, Flexible Studies, was near useless because she’d seen it rated as “just orange” in a Class Guide where feats were power ranked.  I agreed that sure, using it for your regular run of physical and social skills would make it pretty situational.  But it’s power comes from having an inkling of something you’re going to face or do that day, and thus selecting the appropriate Lore skill.  Confident the party will be wondering through a wooded area which locals claim is home to some sort of large animal that lives there?  Sure, her character might be Trained in Nature.  But if the character is sporting just a +1 or +2 Wisdom modifier, it’s probably better to select Animal Lore that day, which now drops the creature identification DC down to Unspecific Lore, typically an Easy check (and thus reducing it by 2).  Has she caught whiff from folks in town the animal is an Owlbear?  Great, she’s now dropped the creature identification DC down to Specific Lore, typically a Very Easy check (and a reduction of 5).  Not only has the DC been reduced, but by using a Lore skill, she’s using her (most likely) maxed Intelligence modifier on the check instead of her Wisdom.  Most likely this will be a +4 modifier.  And at this point her chances of a crit on the creature ID check are going to be great!\n\nAgain, it’s sad, but I think there are many DMs out there that don’t play this way (even though it’s in the Core Rulebook).  So I support any video you make, whether in the past or going forward, that highlights and embraces such use of knowledge in the game.', 'I havent come across anything immune to force damage yet!', 'A couple of scrolls of Ghostly Weapon will go a long way to help with those random ghosts... or.. run and fight them again at a later date.\n\nAlso... a quick way to get positive damage is to bring flasks of water and quickly make them holy water with the sanctify water feat (page 105 of Gods and Magic).\n\nMonks are fairly good at dealing with resistances... with the correct feats (Ki Spells), they can deal with nearly every threat...

I really like the viemexis sheet, everyone I've shown it to feel more comfortable giving pf2e a shot now haha."", 'For reference, I’ve been running multiple PF2e games per week since it came out three years ago.  About half of those campaigns have been with 4th-8th graders, none of whom struggle with the math.  But for the purpose of this comment, I’ll focus on the 5e-only players that have made their way into my other campaigns over that time.\n\n1.  While the math WAS something many brought up early on, most have heard by now that’s not really the issue.  Sure, some might still be living on that fear, but it’s taken a backseat to concern over all the rules.\n\n2.  Specifically, most people I’ve talked with are concerned about all the conditions and how many they will have to, as players, remember.  I definitely think this has validity.  Sure, I’ve been playing religiously for three years and even I can’t reel off all 42 conditions, that’s how infrequent most of them are.  But perception is EVERYTHING, especially when it comes to facing new things.  There’s a massive disconnect between the actual reality of needing to know ANY conditions going into your first campaign (as a player) and the perception many have that you have to know all 42, or even a quarter that number.  Finding ways to fix that disconnect should be, in my mind, paramount.  \n\nTo be clear, I’m not suggesting conditions don’t matter.  They very much do in every campaign, and usually in every session.  I’m only suggesting that potential new players shouldn’t get too wrapped up in needing to know them all going into a campaign.  Because until players do become more familiar with them, any DM worth their salt should be describing the mechanical impacts when a player receives them.\n\nBut there ARE certain conditions that any player will quickly learn as it becomes apparent early on how important they are.\n\n3.  The crazy reality about all those conditions is that in most cases a player need only understand eight simple concepts:  A Status bonus, a Circumstance bonus, a Status penalty, a Circumstance penalty, Action increase, Action loss, the improvement of Movement, and the hampering of Movement.  So really it’s understanding the positive and negative sides of those four coins.  Because the majority of the 42 conditions are going to apply one of those eight things.\n\n4.  In my humble opinion, these 8 concepts are what every video trying to simplify PF2e for potential new players should focus on.  Instead of worrying about explaining all the conditions, focus on the 8 main things those conditions do, and how they apply to a character and enemy in any given combat.  Because when you actually dissect 2e combat, those are the concepts you are actually using to maximize offensive efficiency (I.E. win the battle).  So yes, conditions might be numerous, but they’re overwhelmingly just variations on a theme.\n\n5.  The other main spot of confusion is all the unnecessary verbal diarrhea.  A selling point for PF2e, especially for the DMs, is that there is a rule for everything.  In many cases, this is a good thing, and the rules are often clearly stated.  But sometimes Paizo has a tendency to use slightly different wording when explaining the same thing.  This causes little discrepancies between RAW and RAI that don’t need to exist.  While these things exist in all systems, too often these inconsistent descriptions do more to damage and further complicate otherwise simple understanding.\n\n6.  In addition to the inconsistent wording, Paizo has a tendency to include too much wording, and, worse, refuse to separate the flavor from the mechanic.  This is never more prevalent than in their spell descriptions.  Many spells will include a flavor line or two, then launch right into the mechanic aspect.  Sure, the mechanics (namely damage and effects) will be included in a list-type format based on potential success outcomes.  That’s simple, and easy to understand.  But way too often Paizo will slip actual mechanics into the flavor, in addition to any potential listed outcomes.  This can confuse people to the point where they aren’t sure if a particular spell might be granting an additional saving throw, on what effect from the spell Incapacitation applies on (if any), or even to what part of the spell a certain range or area applies.\n\nThis definitely isn’t the norm.  But when something like this does pop up, it can be super confusing.\n\n7.  I agree that character creation and builds are thought to be more complex, and thus are much harder.  I also agree that while they are more complex by nature of more choice, they are far easier because you don’t have as much pressure of picking an option that will make or break your character.  You not only get to build for pure flavor, if you wish, but you get to adapt on the fly.  Halfway through a campaign as a Barbarian that likes to grapple creatures when hitting them?  If you find yourself on a team where teamwork in combat is efficient and crits become second nature for you, ditch the higher level feat guaranteeing a regular Grab effect on a normal successful hit for something else you’ll use more often.  Four levels in and you realize your DM has a disturbing, even unhealthy Fey fetish?  Pick up Fey Fellowship on your Gnome Bard next level and have a kink-off both in and out of combat.  The list of such possibilities for a character is pretty endless.  \n\n8.  There’s also the perception that you can’t min/max in 2e, which just isn’t true.  Sure, you won’t be as uber powerful as in other systems, but any character can be min/maxed.  Furthermore, I’d argue min/maxing looks different in 2e because the system by default is built to enforce teamwork.  So truly maxing out is increasing the effect or frequency of any teamwork-style play.  Playing a Bard with Cooperative Soul, a dip into Swashbuckler Multiclass for One For All, and a maxed out Diplomacy?  Congrats.  You can now help your martial crit on the regular.  And that’s fantastic, because she just picked up a rider effect on her crit hits to lower a target’s AC that applies when everyone else in your party makes an attack.  And that’s wonderful because now your more heavily focused blaster caster can get their crit on.  \n\nAnyways, thanks for another great video.', ""I don't think it's the math that frightens people, I think it's the 42 conditions and the fact that you need to keep track of all of the +1s, +2s, -1s and -2s from all the items, abilities and conditions"", ""It's not that PF2's character sheet is hard to understand, it's that it's the ugliest thing that has ever existed on earth, I can never make a character because everytime I look at a sheet my eyes bleed out of my sockets"", '5e people if you see this pathfinder 2e isn’t devoid of story either just cause it had a bit more mechanics', 'Pathfinder 1st edition was 3.5 ... ... and 3.5 had a LOT of number crunching, especially the skill points and item weight calculations and extra bonuses you got for getting a specific amount of skill points in a skill...', 'I remember a 5e player I was chatting with online saying that he isn’t interested in Pathfinder 2e cause there are too many choices and that, along with more rules, means you have to spend weeks studying the game in order to be “good” at it.\nI was like: “literally just get your character’s key ability score to 18 at 1st Level.

PF2 takes pride in ensuring accurate encounter balancing, so pre-fight buffs had to go.', ""This is a pretty good channel, I'm glad I stumbled upon it"", 'Buffs are amazing in PF2e.  As you said, a +1 to attack or AC is just as effective at level 1 as it is at level 20.  As I’m sure you’re aware, that’s because the math is so tight that the numbers scale up together.  More specifically, the minimum number which a character needs to role to hit a creature’s AC is always going to be the same at every level.  This is true for any encounter level.  A character will need to roll the same number or higher to hit an on-level opponent at level 5 as they will to hit an on-level opponent at level 17, for example.  This is provided they’ve increased their accuracy mod (usually Str or Dex) at every available level, have added the appropriate item bonus to their weapon at every available opportunity, and have no other modifiers in place.  That means any Status or Circumstance bonus to hit skews this scale, as do any penalties to the opponent’s AC.  This is also why teamwork is so important in combat, as it maximizes the efficiency of everyone involved.  There aren’t many types of bonuses, as you point out in this video, but stacking the ones you can is extremely effective, and inflicting penalties is just gravy.  Often this number stacking comes from teammates flanking, tripping, grappling, and any debuff spell a caster can toss out, like Fear.  There are some absolutely deadly combos, though, like a Bard using Dirge of Doom in a party with a Rogue and/or multiclassed martial/Rogue with the Dread Striker feat.  That’s effectively a guaranteed +3 to hit any applicable creature.  And that’s just imposed penalties.  A character with a circumstance bonus to hit (from a class feat or something) gets to stack that with these penalties.  The same goes for anyone with a Status bonus.  And by mid-game, it’s not unreasonable for many players to be attacking at what is effectively a +8 to +10 to hit.\n\nBut I definitely agree with you that the impact of buff & debuff spells can feel inherently weak, even when we know that’s not the case.  I really like the idea of adding feats that can increase the duration of certain buffs.  Lingering Composition is excellent for this, but of course that’s pretty much just for the Bard.  Then again, I’d like to see the Bard remain as the preeminent force multiplier, so maybe such feats for other classes would be much more specific as to what can be extended. \n\nRegardless, great video!', 'Buffing is awesome', 'A question from one Potemkin Bus Tour Driver to another: How do you feel about the Bless spell in particular?

It may be a bit gamey, tho.\n\nIn the meanwhile, you could houserule the casters could, as an exploration activity, ready their action all the time to cast their buff at the start of fight.

Telling the Fighter that their hard work and training has given them an innate magical +1 to hit, but then telling the Sorcerer with literal magical blood that they don\'t get that same bonus to spells despite getting it to bonk things with their staff... That just doesn\'t feel good to me. That said I\'ll probably borrow an idea from this vid and make them ""channel"" that bonus through something like a staff or wand, in the same way I won\'t give the ABP bonus to AC to a character that isn\'t wearing armor or Explorer\'s Clothes to ""channel"" that into (to keep Dex bonuses in check), so thank you very much for that idea!\n\nEdit: After looking through things and seeing multiple mentions of the Shadow Signet, I think I\'m also going to make it so that the ABP bonus to spell attack rolls doesn\'t apply to attacks made using a Shadow Signet. Boom, the bonus to hit will equal out in most cases and the Signet becomes a tool for specific situations instead of an item that\'s basically required.', 'We use homebrew to add item bonuses to all spells', ""Mark Seifter actually talked about this live on a Knights of Last Call interview and directly answered the question of how can you put item bonuses to spell attacks in to the game and stay balanced?  I don't recall the full extent of his answer but I do know one of the biggest points he made was that you would have to remove True Strike from the game.  True strike alone alters the math more than those missing item bonuses do all on its own.  \n\nEither way, I've homebrewed a bunch of stuff like this.  Mostly tied to specific schools of magic or specific spells."", 'I think they should get rid of spell attack rolls entirely and rely on the success-failure system they already use. It keeps the system uniform and allows every prepared spell to be useful.', 'Yes, no question about it to me.', 'I am in the ""spell attacks should get item bonuses."" Camp\n\nA spell attack takes double the actions and uses up a very limited resource. Damage-dealing spells are often very weak if not using a max level spell slot.\n\nVersatility only goes so far. It\'s cool to have options, but if those options are weak, then they\'re not really options. \n\nPlus, you never know whether it\'s better to target AC or a specific save until you either make a TON of recall knowledge rolls (and assuming your GM doesn\'t waste your time with useless info because RK is broken) OR you\'ve already wasted a resource, blindly attacking in order to find out\n\nIf spell attacks did damage on a miss, I guess they wouldn\'t need accuracy as much.', ""I'm definitely with Paizo on this one. There's two main problems as I see it:\n\n1. People act like the Fighter is the baseline on accuracy. It's like acting like a raging barbarian is the baseline on damage. No.\n\n2. People want to play their own game instead of adapting and overcoming. What makes spell casters strong is that they're versatile. They have a lot of specialized tools, you have to use the right tool for the right job. A hammer doesn't solve every problem but people just want to hit things with a hammer. They want to look at the biggest damage spells, declare them the best (even though they have built in drawbacks for the raw power), and then bitch when it doesn't work everytime. Target the right save. Hit casters with fort saves, hit brutes with reflex saves, etc. If you must use your one tool then use a damn shadow signet. That easily makes up the difference."", 'So comparing casters\' spell attacks to fighters is definitely the wrong paradigm. At levels 19-20, casters are a single point down to most martials, and the existence of Shadow Signet amounts to a roughly 1-2 point swing.   There is no late game issue with spell attacks, even before getting into things like True Strike or Heroism or inflicting fear or clumsy. \n\nNow, there are two pain points that I do address via house rules, and I\'d suggest others adopt it. The 5-6 and the 13-14 level stretches do see casters down 3-4 points on their bonus versus standard martials, and that does sting no matter what number swingers you\'ve got. During those levels only, I have found it healthy to my games to give casters a +2 item bonus to their spell attack rolls, bringing them back into the range of being down 1-2 points to most martials. \n\n1-2 points down is fine, there\'s a number of ways to boost those numbers and while I find the ""casters can just target saves so spell attacks aren\'t a problem lol"" response to be dismissive and unhelpful, it is also true that casters should have the tools to target all defenses and should go after the most advantageous, and there will often be times that is not AC, but there may be times it is, and 1-2 points can be surmounted, but 3-4 is a steeper hill that can feel invalidating to the effort put in.', 'One thing I ran into in my last game that I don\'t see talked a lot about is how the elite template affects things. Because we had 5 people our DM tried to level the playing field by applying the elite template to most things. Unfortunately this seriously hampered our casters (cleric and bard) because not only did we not get runes, be we also couldn\'t benefit from flanking. That, paired with the Incap trait meant that by the end of the AV adventure path, our casters were only successful about 15% of the time and only had critical successes when the enemy rolled a 1 on the save. This versus the fighter and champion who would crit pretty often with their flanking bonus on top of gear. I don\'t want broken casters either, but I do want to feel like I can contribute more than ""I heal the fighter"".', 'I want my spellcasters to be impactful not game-breaking so I like the enhancements for specialties/items and have homebrewed talismans for example that work like that in my games :; shrug :: it is all about keeping it fun and engaging!']"

I mean I\'m not a designer but I played 2e for two full campaigns and some smaller projects here and there and in both incap spells or abilities were either not used or when used correctly (there was some time where we didn\'t realize what it did) just didn\'t do anything. And that\'s more a problem with 2e\'s encounter design maybe but the sort of fights that I want to avoid by using incap magic are the ones against creatures that would fuck me up if I don\'t, but single-threat enemies tend to be above grp level so these spells fall flat for that purpose. Dont get me wrong dominate in a group battle can be worth it but the majority of fights I had in these two campaigns were either against single monsters or small groups (2-4) with sometimes a tougher boss-type enemy attached.\nNow if you want to design a magic system that limits casters more than 1e, why not just cut out these incap spells or put them at a higher level, limit them to creature types, have them cost X gp worth of material components per use, make using them risky bc controlling someone makes you more prone to other attacks, or maybe just do what they did with teleportation and make them all uncommon or even rare. Want to get a cool spell like dominate, well that\'s forbidden knowledge nowadays bc of the messed up implications of such a spell existing, go quest to some thassilonian ruin to get it idk, they remade the world and game they could\'ve easily done smth like that.\nIt\'s true that spellcasters were demigods in 1e and had to be taken down a notch, as a longtime spellcaster player I agree but at times it feels like Paizo overreached a bit. It\'s balanced in group play of course, that\'s what the game excels at but the overreach to me is more like a world building thing, it\'s better for the game but worse for the world is what I\'m trying to say. Like now there are all these spells that for no in-world reason just flat-out don\'t work on certain people and sure you can say it\'s bc of their ""power"" or force of will or whatever but level is just an abstraction that informs the other stats, it\'s not real (and it shouldn\'t be in my opinion) an ogre captain with a weak will score explicitly lacks that strong of a will, that is the fantasy associated with that sort of enemy. Having a spell that can exploit something like that can be very cool, if they are rare enough or hard to obtain these wouldn\'t end every boss battle and the martials in 2e have more than enough spotlight moments these days.\nIt\'s not like the olden days when hasted and flying wizards did all the cool shit and flung endless spells while the martials plucked their nose, 2e spellcasters are super limited compared to 1e casters, they have a fraction of spellsslots due to lack of bonus spells and those spells all (with the exception of cantrips) have been nerfed in some way, they have achieved balance - so imo it won\'t be campaign ending to have some rare powerful or high-level spells that just do cool shit without a billion caveats to ensure wizards don\'t ever step out of their balancing bucket.

I would also give away well known info on a failure (like troll regeneration)', 'About the troll example, personally i’d say a very low roll would allow a PC to know about its regeneration but a higher dc would also give the knowledge on how to prevent it, also with crit fails giving out false weaknesses and resistances is theoretically fun, but metagaming can nullify that, depends on your group i suppose (also thank you for your amazing videos they are great, i love your content !)', ""I usually ask my players what kind of information they are trying to recall and give information based on that. so if they ask for vulnerability I will give them weaknesses or resistance or regeneration or their worst save, something that could be related to harming the creature.\n\nif they don't specify the kind of information they are looking for then I usually base it off of the knowledge skill they used, so if they use arcana they would get info on the enemy's spells or their strong save or something like that."", 'Recall knowledge was written that way because Paizo was covering all uses of the action, not just some.\n""I want to recall knowledge about that play this lord says is his favourite"" - Bard\nIs going to be different than...\n""I want to identify this this monster I am fighting"" - Fighter\nWhich is also going to be different than...\n""I want to know what this lock is made from"" - Inventor\n\nUnder the Recall Knowledge action description, Paizo lists the possible information which can be gained...\n\nThe example used in the CRB I have open is about Golems, and if a player uses Arcana, they might learn about its magical defences whereas if they used Crafting, they learn about its physical resistances.\n\nOf course the key word is ""useful""... telling the players things they already know is the opposite of ""useful"".\n\n""*Critical Success* You Recall the knowledge accurately and gain additional information or context.\n*Success* You Recall the knowledge accurately or gain a useful clue about your current situation.\n*Critical Failure* You Recall incorrect information or gain an erroneous or misleading clue."" Core Rulebook Page 239\n\nI see... you\'re complaining about page 506... Then, yes, the examples they gave are... um... not helpful...  as they were for very well known monsters. However, there is a paragraph about\n*Additional Knowledge*\n""Sometimes a character might want to follow up on a check to Recall Knowledge, rolling another check to discover more information. After a success, further uses of Recall Knowledge can yield more information, but you should adjust the difficulty to be higher for each attempt. Once a character has attempted an incredibly hard check or failed a check, further attempts are fruitless -- the character has recalled everything they know about the subject.""\n\nSo, using the the general guideline: ""For a check about a specific creature, trap, or other subject with a level-based DC (adjusting for rarity as needed). You might need to adjust the difficulty down, maybe even drastically, if the subject is especially notorious or famed. Knowing simple tales about an infamous dragon\'s exploits, for example, might be incredibly easy for the dragon\'s level, or even just a simple trained DC."" \n\nHere\'s how Recall Knowledge ""should"" be done...\nPCs meet an unidentified monster. They roll for recall knowledge. However, this monster is well known to the party, as they were warned that there is a band of them living in the forest somewhere, which makes the DC check Incredibly Easy for the monster\'s Level DC. The Monster is a Troll, a CR 5 Monster. Thus, the Base DC to identify the troll is 20 - 10 = 10. If the player has Giant Lore, then the DC is reduced by another 2 to 8.\n\nA level 1 player could roll anywhere from a 0 (untrained with a negative ability score) to 27 (trained with a maxed ability score) to identify the troll. Possibly a bit higher if they have feats/abilities/items which increase their rolls.\n\nIf the player rolls a 10 to 14 the player(s) learn the *basic* information about the Monster: This is a troll, it is indeed as large as you were told, it has regeneration, hates being burned, and speaks Jotun. _(popular cultural information)_ ~For critical failure, replace hates fire with hates acid, thus the players won\'t ""know"" the weakness to fire.~\nIf the player rolls a 15 to 19 the player(s) learn *intermediate* information about the Monster: It\'s tough and quick for its size, but lacks wits. _(information about AC and saves)_ ~For Critical Failure, ignore the wits, and down play its toughness.~\nIf the player rolls a 20 to 24 the player(s) learn *advanced* information about the Monster: While they are distracted by tearing a foe asunder, they can still claw frightened foes who attempt to run from them. _(information about abilities)_ ~For a critical failure, mention how it prefers to grab people to eat them while they are alive.~\nIf the player rolls 25+ the player(s) learn *specific* information about the Monster in addition to the rest: This individual likes composing crude poems as it wanders the forest (or something specific to its gear/items not seen by the players). _(information that can help roleplay/fight the specific individual)_ ~For a critical failure, make other stuff up, lol.~\n\nThe GM should ask the player if the player wants another roll for more information... and then give it to them as part of their initial recall knowledge action until they don\'t want the information or until they fail.\n\nThe thing is... not every GM will have a list of DC\'s for every monster and how much information the players could recall based on how good they roll so... Paizo has left it vague on purpose. Why should the GM prepare lists like I did for everything if the players won\'t use Recall Knowledge most of the time, right? Too much prep for no benefit, lol. Yeah... so, it\'s up the GM to decide the information the players learn and... not all GMs are able to be spontaneous... :/']"

TBH, if a Swasbuckler can aid with diplomacy and gain panache, I don't think it's too far off to say that a cleric could use a religion check to aid and attack, or a bard performance.\nMy go-to example is the Barbarian is in reach of a target, IMO it's very sensible to let him attempt to aid the Fighter's Strike with an Athletics check after that.

If by 'you' they mean they know you exist then you could never assassinate them even if you catch them asleep, but if by you they mean 'your body in proximity to them' then if they are scrying on an illusion of your body in Taldor when you're actually hidden, silenced and invisible behind them in Absalom I would treat that as unnoticed. Typically though, you should be fine as long as it's your first attack and none of the enemies has reason to suspect you are there.\n\nThinking about Mark of Death, one way to use that on an enemy is divination. Scrying would work, or Shared Senses with a familiar. I think casting abilities go nicely with this archetype, and the archetype only has a few feats that are useful and there is no real benefit to taking this dedication immediately even if you can take it at 2nd level. Mixing this with a caster dedication - or better yet, a Red Mantis dedication - makes for an effective character with options for invisible/silent/true strike.

The mastermind rogue can use ""Analyse Weakness"" to reach the same amount of damage output as assassinate while only needing to recall knowledge (which they are insanely good at) and have the target flat footed. This brings the precision damage to 6d6 at level 11 once in a round. And if you can cast spells with a dedication, you can go even further with only one feat more than the assassin dedication and gain way more versatility. As it is I would never take the assassin archetype.']"

Before you is a vast stretch of near-nothingness. Beneath your body is empty space, feeling as air, yet you can press against it all the same to stand.  \nNear-nothingness because in all directions there exists naught but a surrounding of stars; a dotted Tapestry so clear and so unobstructed you feel as though you might weep. Your tears fall infinitely to the void.   \nYou test your steps - you certainly are walking, though regardless of how ""far"" you go, nothing ever shifts. You are in the middle, but logically your perspective is infinitely far away. It dizzies you, so you cease your efforts.  \nThen, all at once, it shifts - one star amongst the vast infinity in front of you... shines? No. It simply stays twinkling while everything surrounding it dulls. Once it is blackened, stiller than anything ever was, it is consumed by the star, and it grows.  \n\nAgain, and again, the edges of Space itself begins to fade, and it is devoured.

You struggle, you crawl on nothingness itself as even It, too, fades.  \nYou think of your past - meaningless in this wake of pure, uncaring destruction. You think of the future, short as it will be before everything winks away. You think of the Lady of Graves, and find that even the thought of Her leaves you wanting. Your loved ones, your dreams, your envies, your grudges - they all lose their weight.  \nYou, too, will be consumed. You *are* being consumed. \nAnd yet... you feel nothing.  \nNo, that isn\'t true - there is still something buzzing away in your heart and your mind as you watch the stars ebb from the corners of your vision and into your puny cone of vision.  \nDespair?

Perhaps there is a sense of uncomfortable comfort in that. That ""of course"" it had to end, to begin again.  \nThe last star struggles. It blinks, it flickers, and you can only feel bad. Not for it - but for its struggle. It is an admirable one; you count twelve, thirteen, fourteen flickers before it finally gives in, out of fight as it goes cold.  \nFor a moment, there is silence.

You have a main thing you can do, your action, which can result in analysis paralysis (especially for spell casters), you have your movement, which you can use as needed. And you have a bonus action which is deliberately restricted to a few things or nothing at low levels.\n\nIn P2e, everything is an action, which sounds simple, but it often results in a lot of questions. ""Can I attack this guy?"" ""Yes, but only once because it would take two actions to get there."" ""Oh, OK, so I should attack this guy?""

And so on and so forth.\n\nNow, don\'t misunderstand me, 5e does suffer from this analysis paralysis when it comes to spells.

The druid can't turn into an Owlbear at all in PF2E (no polymorphing spell or feature allows for that form), and in D&D only using that games version of the Shapechange spell, which wouldn't be until 17th level, which is way higher than any of the characters in the movie are.  That is also the only spell in either system that allows for swapping between forms without using the ability again or casting another spell, none of which is depicted by Doric (the druid's name).  Also in PF2E the barbarian would not only get hit, but hit ALOT because barbarians, especially when raging, have a penalty to AC.  In either case, in the movie at no point do they overtly depict her going into a Rage, but her untouchable nature could just as easily be abstracting her not taking any damage, which is definitely more the purview of a D&D barbarian with their resistances.  Tesseract Tunnel absolutely is the closest analogue to the Portal gun staff depicted in the movie, nothing in D&D works quite like that.  On Xenk, the paladin's Daggersword, it doesn't strictly fit the limitations of a shifting rune, and it has been officially canonized in the lore of D&D both on D&D beyond and on the Forgotten Realms wiki.  The interruption is actually precisely from D&D, her concentration was interrupted, not her spell, as she had already successfully cast it, this is the least Pathfinder example in your list.  Precisely the rule ignored in the previous point is made in the next point, about the red wizard concentrating on 2 spells at once (this analysis is correct). She wasn't just flanked but repeatedly grappled and had to break out.  Misty step exists in D&D, there is nothing like it in PF2E in the first place, so spell slots aren't an issue, when there is no spell in PF2E that even works as depicted in the first place.  The closes analogue is dimension door, which is a 4th level spell in both systems, whereas Misty Step could come from several sources in D&D and be a nearly free cast for the wizard.  Its more likely she simply didn't cast it again, not that she couldn't. A character not dying is a signature issue in D&D over Pathfinder, but a hero point wasn't spent, an item was used (being vague for the same reasons you were in the video).  So in that list, only concentrating on two spells, and the hither tither staff are solid arguments, and there is potential counters to that; She had the dual-focused feat from the Tal'Dorei Campaign setting book (many tables allow feats, items and spells from other settings).  The Hither Tither staff was a custom item the GM created for the movie, so was the Helmet of Disjunction, also there is no challenge by default in either system for either attuning or investiture of magic items, which was depicted in the film. Additionally, the bard didn't cast any spells either, which isn't accurate to either D&D or PF2E.  So I think a fairer argument is that the film wasn't faithful to the rules of any game, it was a depiction not a 1 for 1 analogue.

Not saying PF2E or any other isn\'t either. I am saying it, 5e in particular, is heavily flawed and people wear rose-colored glasses with how good it is. I have explained myself why it is not a good system, but popularity due to outside source influence on society led people to play. That was a good thing to bring people in the community, the problem is the obsession of playing it and ONLY it caused many other great systems that are far better. The defense comments of the system are not unique to 5e. All the arguments for how good are system neutral arguments. Things like roleplay, customization of rules, rule of cool, or even homebrew. NO system stops or prohibits any of that thus that is not an argument for 5e specifically. So I always argue how bad it is based solely on the fact I have NEVER seen a play group, that isn\'t organized play, that loves to play the system RAW. Everyone says it is VERY bad if you play how it was designed to be played. That is VERY telling of the system.\n\nIt is called 5e because that was ALWAYS the intent. D&D has always worked were new editions were not compatible with prior editions. The ones that were had a caveat to the title. 3.5e, AD&D, etc. This was going to be compatible and thus the reason it was 5.5e being called by the community. Surprise, surprise it is called 5e officially confirming the vast majority calling it 5.5e all this time. I have never accepted 6e because I knew it was not a full on new edition. YEARS ago they said the next edition they put out would be fully compatible with 5e. This told me all that time ago a full new edition would be far more delayed. They wanted to milk 5e dry until the community was really tired of it. The community just kept buying the products thus showing WotC they can still get money out of it.

I’d rather they made characters a little tougher at 1st & 2nd levels so there’s less desire to skip them, but stop a lot of the numerical scaling by 10th, so the playable life of a character is extended.  A lot of items should have their power based on a character’s level, so maybe with +X weapons, the bonus is equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), and they require attunement to get the bonus (otherwise they’re normal weapons of good quality that are able to hit ghosts and such).\n\nTo make combat costly even if you win, they could have a miss within 10 still cause half damage.  10 or more over is double damage, +0 to +9 is normal damage, -1 to -9 is half damage, and -10 or more is no damage.  Natural 20 and 1 are effectively +10 or -10, rather than auto-hit or auto-miss.  That’s loosely borrowed from Pathfinder 2e.\n\nI’d also take the 10-level exhaustion system from recent D&D playtests, in which you get -1 per level to every d20 test until the 11th level kills you.  Add a -5 foot movement penalty per level, so once you’re past 5, you need to ‘dash’ to get anywhere.  You’d get an exhaustion level when you hit 0 HP and for every failed death save.  You don’t die at three death saves, but the accumulating -1 penalties will likely cause a death spiral to 11 exhaustion if you don’t get help.  Exhaustion can only be removed 1 level at a time per long rest, which you can only benefit fron once per day.  While you have any exhaustion levels, the effect of healing is halved.

Fair enough.  There was a time when I was that player back during my 3.5 days.  I know some call it bad game design, and maybe it is.  I’d call it a system not made for everyone.  Still, it’s frustrating to hear yet another 5e player obviously bothered by an inability to tweak every aspect of character creation and game design in his favor.  I feel like if that’s your main goal, it would be much easier to just play a video game like Skyrim or Witcher and set your difficulty level to easy.  \n\nAs for this particular video, I think it’s healthy to have Archetypes of varying power levels.  The entire point of them is to not just flavor your character, but pick up the slack in certain areas where necessary.  The Medic isn’t overpowered by any means, and it’s certainly not a must-have.  As strong as it can be, you get diminishing returns the more healing abilities people have in your party.  It can be a godsend if you don’t have healing spellcasters in the party, but not everyone plays that way.  Suspicion Instinct Barbarian?  A Medic becomes much more powerful.  But if you’ve got a Bard or Champion healing in your party, Medic loses some luster.  Even things like the Acrobat as a Dedication-only grab is fine.  A Druid picking up the Fighter Archetype to grab AoO and several action reduction feats like Sudden Charge is fine, and allows a player to play their Druid like a competent full time shapeshifter.\n\nOn top of filling out different roles, having different strength levels of Archetypes should be something that draws 5e players like a moth to flame.  Which sort of begs the question I always have with all these 5e power players that love to maximize every build.  If you love combining different classes through multiclassing in 5e, how can you not live for the challenge in Pathfinder 2e, which now has over 160 Archetypes available.  Seriously, I’ve been watching some 5e content creators that really embrace building the best possible builds they can, and embrace breaking the system.  While they won’t find the same extreme highs and lows in PF2e, there are definitely some strong potential builds out there to be made.\n\nSpeaking of those channels, it’s often hard to get past the irony that 5e has this massive fanbase, many of whom live to create these really powerful builds, only to have most of their character’s strengths functionally irrelevant like 80% of the time during actual combat gameplay.  The Advantage/Disadvantage mechanic is so overpowered that it steals away the relevance of player agency in 5e combat.  The main driving force behind my groups quitting 5e back in the day was the realization that combat was pretty much everyone just sitting around trying to secure Advantage/Disadvantage.  It was often all you needed to swing the pendulum your way.  But the rub there is it doesn’t stack, so once you have it there’s no real incentive for a character to do anything else.  I’d have players describing all these cool things their character would do, like getting to high ground.  All in the name of securing Advantage for themselves.  Great tactics that 100% matter—when you don’t already have Advantage.  But at any given time another character has secured it for others, or inflicted Disadvantage on an enemy already.  So as fun as describing such an action can be, when much of the time the mechanical benefit is effectively 0, what’s the point?  The fun of it?  Why bother with any rules at that point?\n\nSo anyway, all these White Room power builds fascinate me because the usability of them ends up being quite low.

That's not to say it gives the same feel I've heard 4E gave, where it's just NOT D&D any more, but it's definitely different.\n\nAdding level into all proficient rolls does feel a bit like the 'proficiency bonus' of 5E, but even less measured.

Every rule is online free on purpose.  Of course, the core rulebook is \n... What? $10 for the PDF?\n\nSo minimum buy in to Pathfinder is an $8 d20 set, and if want the core rulebook for convenience and organization rather than looking all up online.... $10 more.\n\nSo what do you NEED? Nothing really.\n\nPaizo's trick is in making you WANT.\n\nTheir books are quite good.  Thick, meaty, well written and well organized.  If were to compare pricing between Paizo and certain sorcerers of the beach.... On a per word or per pound basis, Paizo is way, way, way cheaper.\n\nAnd I think their books are better.  More content, better written and organized.\n\nAnd then, how much do you want to spend? Cheap pdf? You want physical? Mini paperback? Full sized paperback? Hardcover? Limited edition?\n\nFrom $0 to hundreds, you'll only spend what you want to spend, you don't actually NEED to spend anything.  Imho, Pathfinder has one of the most consumer friendly and most flexible offerings of books, giving you the most say and what you do and do not want to spend money on for it.\n\nIf, for example,.you really loved the Magus class, but nothing else from secrets of magic interested you... You don't need to buy the book to play a Magus.  All the rules are online.  But if you DO buy the book... It's going to be a very nicely written and organized book, full of content... And if on a tight budget, well the pdf is only a few bucks.  Or if you know youll love this book and reference it often... Get a physical copy.... Hardcover? Maybe you love the Magus class so much you want the limited edition hardcover?  You get my point.\n\nIn short, I think Paizo has the best model out there for this sort of thing.\n\nAll that remains are videos like this to guide people to what they WANT.  Which books will most enhance their game.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I prefer Pathfinder and Paizo.  I love their pricing and sales model.

Examples of game companies run well imho.\n\nIt's a lot easier to spend money on their products when every purchase is one you are glad you made, and you are consistently impressed with the quality of what you got... And the prices are all reasonable.\n\nThis is why companies like Paizo and Catalyst will ALWAYS have easier access to my wallet.  Their business practices make it clear they've no interest in burning me or extorting the last nickel they can from a transaction. They profit by selling quality products to people that want them and are happy to have bought them.  Thus, as a consumer, there is a higher level of a trust, and lower threshold to make a purchase.  I'll drop $10 or $15 on a whim for a book.... And then decide if I want a physical copy later... And what edition I want.  It's EASY for me to spend a few bucks on these companies. They have easier access to my wallet.\n\nThis consumer friendly model ignores the ridiculous Humble Bundle bargain.  That's just a stupid deal.  Don't analyze, don't think, just buy it next time it happens. That bundle makes a claim for best bargain in the history of gaming.\n\nTake the recent catalyst BattleTech Mercenary Kickstarter.... Never even crossed my mind that Catalyst would screw me.  They've no interest in that.  Just funding to make a new batch of mech minis... Went way, way over their projections, so they just got more and more generous in what they'd give away in packages and make available.  Result was they had a jaw dropping Kickstarter (about 3x bigger than last one), and I got a smokin deal on a mercenaries box with lots of extra goodies.  Fairly certain there were only winners in this business transaction.  Everyone walks away smiles.\n\nThis is what I mean by easier to spend money on certain companies.  My threshold for buying Paizo products is very low. A few other companies in same position by acting similarly.  It might not be the most aggressive sales model, but it seems highly effective from my perspective, and both example companies have gotten a lot of money from me in the last year.  Both are having a fantastic 2023 so far.  So perhaps that consumer friendly sales model has some advantages after all?\n\nAlso, the beginner box is probably the best intro beginner box in gaming.

You get permission to make the item through several other means too: skill investment, feat investment, and formulae (which also have a monetary value and therefore require either a time investment, a monetary investment, or a threat to your life investment via dungeon delving/adventuring).

It\'s silly, so I suspect that this feat is either written on the assumption that rules to handle that sort of thing exist (a thing that was quite common in 1e, with writers referencing rules from 3.5e that were never actually ported over into Pathfinder, so it might well be that the writer assumed that this rule from 1e was included in 2e even though it isn\'t actually in the book), or is written *to bring those rules into existence,* either referencing a general rule that is to be added to the base Crafting skill via an erratum, or by creating that contingency as a feature of the Skill Feat in question.']"

The base idea for the Trap actually came out of Sweeden in the early 70s that Scotty Bowman adapted and advanced its concept while coaching the Montreal Canadiens in the mid to late 70s. It's not  about a heavy forecheck, it is a directed forecheck scheme though that tries to take the middle of the ice and force breakouts to pick one side or the other leading into the real Trap mechanics that happen in the neutral zone where the defending team close off passing lanes and slowly cut off the puck carrier.\nThe Canadiens version was more offensively geared trying to force turnovers to generate counter attacks.\nLemaire, the New Jersey coach that Chris mentioned, who was a player on those earlier Canadiens teams, then took the concept went full defensively with it. His version no longer focused on generating turn overs but instead focused on making the attacking team dump the puck into the defenders zone and chasing it at which point the defending players would block and interfere with the attacking teams ability to chase while Martin Brodeur, one of the best puck handling goalies in NHL history would get the puck with ease and turn it back up the ice. It was a very boring and very stifling way to play the game.\nFunny enough a few years later, the same coach from the 70s, Scotty Bowman once again modified a system used on the bigger ice in Europe to break the the really defensive version of the Trap called the Left Wing Lock which basically trapped the Trap by bringing the puck up one side of the ice but just as the defenders started closing in on them prior to the center ice line, would fire the puck hard to the opposite side of the ice slightly backwards to either another forward or even a defenceman already moving at near full speed who would then fly into the defenders zone with little resistance. \nIn honour of Chris, I had to geek that out lol\nThis is what happens when 40 years of playing D&D and 45 years of playing/coaching hockey collide 😊"", ""Was enjoying this right up until Tabletop Bro revealed he used Dall-E for his character art.

While I agree that one system can serve two audiences; my mind ultimately includes the words ""for most of their interests"". Because while serving two separate audiences, it\'s not serving both of them to their fullest needs/wants.  Thus, the far better solution would be to include multiple rulesets within an edition officially supported to foster both audiences in their own endeavors. \n\nOne of the largest complaints I see in 5e communities is that 5e doesn\'t support what they wish to do in their games. My response is that there are other systems that support their needs better. Of course, they respond with things such as ""Oh so you just think 5e is bad?"". I don\'t, I just know for a fact that a single system cannot be everything to all involved. If you design a system to be so generalistic, you are in fact designing a game that falls short for a large portion of the playerbase.\n\nYou enjoy Pathfinder, which I believe is superior when it comes to combat. However, it also, imho, handles other things poorly (and 5e handles much better). WoTC takes a very middling stance on design, have crunched the majority of their content into what effectively is 3/4 of their intended ""progression"" (they\'ve written nothing above like level 14 or 16), and simply does not support DMs in their endeavors. Especially when they maintain the ""DMs Fiat"" from earlier editions, but are also taking steps to ensure PC features/abilities specifically state what they are capable of doing so that DMs can\'t intercede with a ruling (see: the most recent video with Jeremy Crawford). It all leaves a poor taste from a consumer stand point really.', 'As a DM with a great deal of experience through various editions, I will say that many (refuse to say all) 5e players approach the table with their entire characters story already figured out in their head cannon. This is very problematic for a DM, especially when you have multiple players with the same approach, but very different stories. You\'re now juggling expectations, instead of juggling the scenarios and options to challenge the PCs into either confirming or denying their original ideals/world views.\n\nCouple that with PC power progression, non-supported higher level official play, and difficulty in balancing encounters with the official toolset... of course newcomers to the hobby will hesitate jumping into the DMs role.\n\nWhere as in the past, it was quite the achievement to reach level 5 on your original character and it was something to truly celebrate. The world is dangerous, and so the PCs had enough on their plate with reacting to this dangerous environment. Far too much to juggle without worrying about your PCs personal story and if the DM is hitting the arcs/story points that you decided before session 1 your character should. \n\nDnD, to me, has always been the DM brings 25% of the story (setting, challenges/scenarios, NPCs), and the Players create the other 75% AT THE TABLE (ie they didnt create their future stories before the campaign even began). Instead, I\'ve encountered players who want to experience personal ""kinks"" and other strange things that shouldn\'t be at the table (or even in front of other people honestly), and its quite annoying, if not creepy AF.\n\nTL;DR: While I have my preference of systems/editions (hint: its actually a mix of quite a few as none have truly hit the perfect mark imho); I truly believe the major difference in interest in becoming a DM in earlier editions, and doing so in 5e can be distilled down to: CULTURE. Expectations these days lean more towards ""I want MY story to be important and spectacular"". In earlier editions (read: culture), it was more akin to ""Whether we live or die, OUR story will be EPIC"".', 'I believe QB\'s comments in regards to location based vs story based adventures has alot to do with what ya might call ""dm training"" or getting someone ""comfortable with dm\'ing"", asking someone who\'s never dm\'ed to dm a quick one shot they created on the spot themselves is different than asking them to dm Curse of Strahd. Not a perfect comparison, but it semi-works. The stress load is different, expections are different, and you are more free to not worry about events negatively impacting the rest of the story, because the rest of the story doesn\'t exist yet. I love story based adventures, but i understand the headache dealing with that brings.\n\nWotC is planning on finding ways of monitizing the playerbase. The standard idea of the dm being the primary if not only customer of the company\'s produced products is something WotC is trying to break, they want dm and players giving them money. Listening to the dm\'s (which account for only a small portion of the total demigraphic) if it\'s at odds with what the rest of their potential market is telling them isn\'t something that fits their current strategy.\n\nWhat qualifies someone to speak as a DM? If they\'ve done it once for an evening? DM\'ed for a certain period of time, or number of games, or not until they\'ve run every current official campaign in the current edition? Some groups co-dm or round robins, so do those people qualify? The entire issue is murky water at best.\n\nThe survey results are... well... how long did they have the material out? not long enough imo, ie if a casual player wanted to test out the new design... they only got to test it a few sessions, and probably not at the various levels to see how the new design feels from level 1 to level 20.

And why is dualwielding is weaker at parrying than one-handed? In terms of balance it isn't necessary at all. Fighter with one-handed bastard sword deals better damage than hypothetical two-handed fencer with one attack already. Which is like most common turn stride-attack-parry. And even with two attacks it is close. And you can go for animal barbarian or monk with dragon stance and grab yourself a shield to be damaging like two-hander, defensive like a shieldbearer (which is much better than a parry and not only because of block, reactive shield also great tool to boost action economy) and still have a free hand for athletics.

You have shown 5 fighters that are completely different from each other. Yes. However, each of them is still incentivized to do the same thing each turn with their third action because of the way they are built. For one fighter, demoralize is a good choice. For another, raise shield is a good choice, and so on and so on. Same thing on almost all turns. Things like grab edge are very circumstantial. \nThe fighter, I played was actually trying to make use of all the different options you mention, but couldn\'t. I was going for a Skald character concept. Meaning something like a educated, charismatic Viking warrior, who will sword and board but considers himself a poet to record their sagas for posterity, while also being educated in the stories of old. Even while building the character i ran into problems because I had to diversify my attributes so much between STR (16), CON (14), INT (14) and CHA (14) that he became inefficient at everything. My expectation was, that my -1 to attack rolls compared to STR 18 would be insignificant in the long run. However, more important than that was that my demoralize action hardly ever worked because CHA 14 just didn\'t cut it. Other party members demoralized better than my character. (It started feeling like a waste of an action for me to try it, letting my party down because with raise shield I might have protected myself better). Also in plate armor with sword and board, I was really slow. In combat, I would spend two actions to move into position, leaving me the option to strike, or to raise shield on turn 1. (or to try a doomed attempt of demoralizing) On subsequent turns, I usually tried striking twice if I was still in position. Often, though, I would have to move again. \nOver the course of my time with that character (lvl 1-7), it became increasingly frustrating how weak the character felt compared to the rest of the party and to my 5e fighters. In my party, the ranger hit more consistently and for more damage. The witch demoralized better and the mage recalled knowledge better, so what they wanted me to do is soak up damage. So, I had leather armor in mind if even that, to be mobile on the battlefield but they wanted me to be their damage sponge and make use of my heavy armor proficiency. But now, I was slow (STR 16 in plate) And still fragile (CON 14). I was more of a hindrance than help to them. Because of my attribute distribution, my saving throws were sort of weak, too, So my stats were often decreased through status effects. \nCompared to 5e, my fighter felt weak in more than one aspect: because the shield bonus to AC only applied when I used an action for it I often couldn\'t do that because I had to move into position, or with reactive shield, I would lose my attack of opportunity. In 5e, I could be tanky, while moving and still have the chance to do an attack of opportunity. The movement aspect was the most frustrating compared to 5e. Because in 5e, I can split my movement any way I want during my turn in combat. At lvl 5, I could move 10 feet, attack, move another 10 feet and attack and still have a bonus action (with varying degrees of usefulness) In PF2e, I would stride, strike and stride. No second attack or anything else. Using two of my three actions striding to move between targets feels so powerless compared to 5e. \nOverall, I felt like my PF2e fighter can attempt things from a larger pool of options than my 5e fighter, but can achieve a lot less than his 5e counterpart in every round of combat. And in my PF2e party, he could achieve less than any of my party members, because I had fallen into the trap of trying to give him too many options when building him. In summary, my fighter felt weak. Not boring, though, because he had many options. Most of them were frustrating, however.

The only immediately obvious synergy is a special armor ability that lets you push yourself once for no stress coupled with an ability that gives you a buff when you push yourself, and that only really improves the effectiveness of the on-push ability by about 25%.', 'Not boring and not weak... okay...

Just work out new rules for generating modifiers, ditch the scores, and whenever you get the relevant powerup you choose between +1 to a modifier or a feat. For one thing, even if you give recommendations you\'re still increasing a player\'s cognitive load where ASIs don\'t, and for another I always enjoy feats more if I feel like there was an opportunity cost beyond not picking another feat.\n2: Completely agree. The restrictions in certain spells and stuff like domains giving interesting new spells was a fun feature of 3.5 and to a lesser degree 5e, and cutting it out would be a shame.\n3: I don\'t really have strong feelings about instadeath, but I honestly don\'t like monster crits as a player or as a GM. Honestly, my preference would be to ditch the death saves system and just bring back 3.5\'s negative HP, but with the amount scaled up so that there\'s a bigger gap between still up and dead for real.\n4: I do feel like there needs to be some kind of rebalancing of saving throw bonuses, but I\'d rather see it be something with some customizability. Like maybe every major advance you get to pick one save to upgrade to half proficiency. As for monsters, I frankly think that giving them big swings in their saves is fine, but what they really ought to do is make Legendary Resistance less binary. Currently, I think it tends to boil down to either ""save-based builds, you can go fuck yourselves"", or it turns into a second HP pool with equally lethal results if it runs out. My ideal version would be a rule where boss monsters can trade legendary actions to ignore major maluses such as not being able to move or act, granting advantage to attack them, or taking disadvantage to their rolls. That way if you nail a boss with Hold Monster it\'s not just ""oop, it spent one Legendary Resistance, your turn is wasted"" because its ability to fight through that cuts down on legendary actions, but at the same time it\'s not a win condition because it can\'t run out.\n5: I hadn\'t heard about the massive nerf to capstones, but I definitely agree that the ones you flashed on screen are lame.

Just codify the language a bit better and make sure your Major Action per turn is always impactful and exciting or useful, and your Minor Action is whatever other flavorful thing you'd like to do."", '5e\'s ""move around"" as a dynamic battlefield may have been an interesting goal, but then they gave _everyone_ an attack of opportunity, so once you\'re smacking things with metal sticks, you just stand there and wail away until either falls over. I find that it\'s _really hard,_ especially as the DM, to make dynamic-feeling battles in 5e.', 'I was in a very similar headspace before watching your video, of one major + two minor actions. I was thinking that maybe you could make each minor action say 20ft of movement, and a major action could be either 30ft or 40ft.\n\n I think that disengage should still be major action unless you are a rogue. And I think that your idea about defence/offence stances is a relatively good one, although flattened maths would probably need some more work to account for it.\n\nConcentration has been a bit of a failure of a mechanic, people forget to roll for it all of the time, so it is not intuitive, so you may be right about the bonus action thing.', 'A 2 Action Point system can easily be added to One D&D and is somewhat Industry Standard. Especially in indie games alongside indie miniature skirmish games. Or potentially something like Super Dungeon Explore. So you get your movement and then something like 3 action points that are spent on different actions. So you could have a current 5e Bonus Action be 1 AP while a Standard Action is 2 AP in this system with classes altering this. So a Fighter might make an Attack action 1AP while a Rogue drops the Dash action to 1AP.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nNote: I am posting this while at the section where you are covering the current 5e mechanics in the History section.', '""I was worried about becoming a lightning rod over comparing PF to DnD 5e. So anyway, DnD 4th edition wasn\'t as bad as you think, and there is something that the designers could learn from it...""\n\nOn the one hand, true sentiment. On the other hand, I don\'t think you realise the irrational hatred people have for that game. If anything, talking about 4e in a neutral to positive light is far more incendiary than your initial concerns.']"

Also I think the number of Regional Activities should increase from three to four at perhaps level 10 or so. I can also think of a few buildings that should be added or adjusted for upgrades.', 'This system is antithetical to roleplaying. I can\'t think of a worse RPG system that creates a series of mechanics where the character has no impact to success or failure for a given action. 0/10\n\nSomeone fell in love with the idea of making your Kingdom a character class and never bothered to test if the idea worked. Your kingdoms Ancestry is the government type,  your background is the charter, the Kingdom progression chart is your class. It doesn\'t work, it is asinine and you can tell it was the result of a ""brainstorming"" session and the developers make the cardinal mistake of falling in love with their own idea and were unwilling to test or admit their failure.\n\n\nThere are 14 skills and you only get 6 skill trainings at the start of the Kingdom progression,  pick the wrong skills and you ruin your Kingdom. You get 9 skill increases so if you used these skill increases to fill in the gaps you would have 14 skills that were trained and one that was expert. And given fast your DC\'s increase you can\'t afford to be unskilled in any skill otherwise you can\'t do much at all. Buildings you say! Buildings give you the bonuses to compensate. Nay. The max item bonus is +3 and it scales up to three. The first 8 lvls of your kingdom can only have a +1 item bonus, 9-14 you can have +2 and finally at level 15 you can have +3. But when your Base DC is 34 minimum more likely it will be 37 or 38 because of control modifiers. That +3 makes no difference doing an action with an untrained skill at higher levels can be impossible you are literally rolling to see if you fail or critically fail. \n\nSecond we saw on this video that even basic Kingdom actions like establishing relations can be impossible if you didn\'t pick the skill training for that skill. Idiocy. Not in failing to pick the skill but that such a basic action is banned from players who didn\'t know. This is not how you make engaging rules for Kingdom play. The whole bloody purpose of the campaign is to create a kingdom and Piazo didn\'t even bother to see if their rules worked? What the fuck was that all about? \n\nLets talk about the idiocy of a skill check to build basic structures.\n\n I want to build a dump and it costs 4 resource points which is idiotic,  you are literally  just setting aside land for people to dump their rubbish into. There is no ""building"" for a medieval dump. No environmental impact studies. Nothing is done but telling the citizens this is the area to dump your crap into. And it cost this many resources? And the DC is 16! WTF were these developers smoking?  But the greatest part is that you can\'t build one until you are a level two Kingdom. That\'s right no matter how skilled you are in industry you can\'t figure out how to tell people to walk over to an assigned spot to dump their rubbish into because that is beyond your ken until level 2. You can build houses which are are lower DC but the knowledge of the Dump is beyond you and is more difficult than building Houses once you do get to level 2. Again we see developers becoming in love with an idea skill checks for building with level restrictions and no stopping to think does this really makes sense? Will this make building a kingdom fun? NO it doesn\'t. Telling players you can\'t build something because they haven\'t ""Leveled up their kingdom"" is idiotic. Countless rolls to build structures over and over again isn\'t gameplay it is asinine drudgery that does nothing to eliminate the micromanagement of settlement building. At least in the old system it was simply a matter of resource management. So a player could do this by themselves for the next session. Now it is a skill roll in skills you are statistically more likely to be unskilled than skilled in and thus failure is the most common outcome, making the whole ""gameplay"" of bookkeeping a lesson in frustration. This added layer doesn\'t remove the bookkeeping, doesn\'t add drama, it just forces banality of countless rolls that WILL hurt enjoyment because of how the system works. RNG shouldn\'t be a factor in the BOOKKEEPING of you kingdom.\n\nThe fatal sin of the system\n\nThey have removed the character from the rulership of the kingdom. Sure the player is part of the drudgery but your ""CHARACTER"" has no impact. They bring no skills, ability bonuses nor feats to the table. They bring NOTHING to the role as a ""leader.""   RPGs are about CHARACTER involvement and separating the character from the Kingdom management is beyond a simple whoopsie.  It is a fatal flaw.\n\nShort demonstration of what is so shit about these rules \n\nPlayer 1 ""We need the Emissary position filled."" \n\nPlayer 2 ""Pick the fighter he doesn\'t have a leader position, yet"" \n\nPlayer 1 ""But he has an 8 wisdom, 10 in charisma and intelligence plus he isn\'t skilled in intimidation, stealth, deception, diplomacy, society or thievery. He is the least qualified person for the position his idea of intrigue is stick a sword in it. What about that Rogue we saved and pledge his undying loyalty to us? He has all the skills plus multiple skill feats that make him the obvious choice for a leader in charge of the Kingdom\'s intrigue.""\n\n Player 2 ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! you can\'t put an NPC into that position! the PC gets a bonus to all checks the NPC gets nothing. Besides none of our skills, ability scores or feats impact any aspect of the role as leader.""\n\nPlayer 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSvJaYxRoB4\n\n\nThis entire system is shit, it is a lesson in idiocy. Nothing about the new system works. It doesn\'t actually address the drudgery of book keeping of settlements, adds hurtles to settlement booking making it MORE time consuming, not less. The skill system is broken. Characters have ZERO impact on success or failure regardless of their suitability for a given position. There is NO integration between character and kingdom. Why rule a Kingdom when nothing that makes up your character has any impact on the Kingdom rules?  I will end this how I began, this system is antithetical to roleplaying. I can\'t think of a worse RPG system that creates a series of mechanics where the character has no impact to success or failure for ANY given action. Imagine playing pathfinder where every action you make in the game is not impacted by any skill, feat or ability score of your character. Would that be fun?

But Alchemist who can\'t even start with an 18 in his primary stat used to hit, be it STR or DEX, is already -1 behind the curve and slowly goes down hill from there. And as many people point out every +1 matters given PF2e\'s crit system being like -3 or -4 to hit compared to other characters your level at end game just feels awful. At least the bmbr build you get a tiny amount of splash damage but go any other route and your basically just a worst whatever.

Technically this isn't true.\n\nMany spell casting classes get bonus spell slots that actually average out to 4 per level. Sorcerers have 4 as a baseline, wizards have 3+their school (or their drain bonded item if a generalist). Clerics have their healing/harming font that gives a huge pile of spell slots at 1st level and can amount to roughly one bonus spell per level in the late game (though it does fall behind a bit).\n\nPsychics start with one spell slot, and get two per spell level. This means that they actually average around 1/2 the spell slots compared to many prominent support spell casting classes. Thus, you actually pay an exceptional price for the ability to smash with cantrips and support with focus points. But, it does feel exceptionally good to critically hit with a cantrip when your psyche is unleashed or to have an amp spell come in clutch.\n\nLastly, also bear in mind that your experiences as a psychic might vary depending on the table's overall investment. An example is the message cantrip, which has the unique trait of allowing someone to use their reaction to take an action on your turn. If you're playing at a more passive table that's less attentive, this could cause encounters to last longer as you throw people off by having them act when they weren't expecting to. Another example is the Guidance cantrip, which can let you save a roll, but only if the GM makes it blatantly clear that the check failed by 1 (or if you ask on literally every check, which is annoying). There's a lot of really cool tools available to the psychic, but it also requires a little more attentiveness by the rest of the table to function well. \n\nPersonally psychic is one of the main classes I play, I love the theme of it, but I felt this was important to mention."", ""Do the bursts for Telekinetic rend need to be adjacent?

In AoA our group found that tactics ultimately boiled down to ""get up close and personal and then spend all actions on super-efficient Striking or Strike enhancing"" which drastically reduced the variety in challenge and tactical play beyond what I think the system is theoretically capable of supporting if it were more open to some of the hardcounter things PF1 did (perhaps not to the same degree and DEFINITELY not a ""non-casters need not apply"" affair).', 'Oh my...

Sure, they get to know the proper skill off the bat, but then it\'s at least straightforward.

The only issue I can see is that another character with a good bonus in that skill might decide to try, then, but they\'d still have to kill an action and succeed on the check. Not to mention that critical failures could still happen. This is how I handle the ambiguous Religion/Nature/Arcana/History checks in DnD 5e, which is all I\'ve run so far.

Otherwise the game suffers a lot in my opinion.\nIn low fantasy RPGs this is not necessary most of the time, because power is obvious. A giant is probably stronger than the whole party and even a ""max level"" party, will never be able to take down a giant alone.\nIn high fantasy RPGs there is the ""human problem"". My first complaint about pathfinder was, that there are ""high level mooks"". In my opinion there should not be such a thing as a ""level 10 cultist"" or a ""level 10 thief"".\nI played RPGs where leveling is ""slower"". At level 1 you are able to defeat a single level 1 creature and at max level you are able to defeat like 4 level 1 creatures. This is ""somewhat"" realistic because in my opinion even the most badass knight IRL has problems against 4 peasants with daggers.\nIn pathfinder a level 10 party can defeat almost unlimited level 1 creatures.\nThis design choice makes it necessary, that mooks level with the party and are relative in level to the party level.\nIts just stupid, that a level 10 mook cultist can defeat like 3 level 6 giants at once.\n\nThis all makes no sense to me  and therefore ever player can as me every time what level a creature is, without a check or action.\n\n""I want to steal the key from the guard.""\n""You critically fail the check, because the guard is 10 levels higher that you. It notices you and strikes. You are now dead.""\n\nThat does not sound like fun.', 'I have two things that impact how I think about RK. My players use Recall Knowledge for decision making. They might ask ""Do I think these Drow are generally really bad and therefore I want to kill them rather than build an alliance with them.  They tend to ask ""What do I hear the gossip is about how bad Drow are"".   If the result is a critical fail (which has happened a couple of times), I might respond with ""Yes you hear terrible tales of them stealing away people and doing bad things to them"" the sort of opposite of a success where I might say as the GM ""You have heard bad and good but they do trade with people and have a normal society, even if it\'s a tough warrior caste type society"".   (Note this particular questions also has layers of heritage/background issues that could relate to it). \n\nThis leads into the next oddity on the rule.  My players are 30 year veterans of roleplaying. Mostly all of them have played in a game every week for that time. They know that Trolls regen and mostly know a lot of detail about monsters. \n\nSo on the basis that the characters have a pretty good knowledge about non-flame retardant mummies.  Why bother making it a secret GM roll?  I often don\'t because the player is already having to suspend disbelief -  The Drow being a perfect example - 3 players tried a ""Do I know Drow hate sunlight"" question on me.  I said try the roll themselves and they all failed with some terrible rolls and one critical failure so I said ""you hear some Drow worship the sun"". \n\nWhy would I make that roll in secret because with their knowledge they already knew Drow don\'t like sunlight as a person (outside of the game). If I make the roll as the GM and it fails, they know they have failed anway in perhaps 75% of cases. \n\nSo I don\'t know where I am going with this, other than my response on Bone devil would be on a success to say ""You know this creature is not an undead because there are various of the typical things you expect that are not right about it"".  But otherwise I agree with what you are saying on the issue around what skill to use and giving them a second attempt. I will certainly adopt that and in some cases I may also allow a roll by the player, especially where they have the knowledge already and are just trying to work out if their character does.', ""I think it's interesting nobody ever recommends giving statistical boosts from recall knowledge (outside of the two mentioned +1 on crits). It seems the community at large recognizes knowledge is power. Just by itself, and not wanting to distract from that. \n\nI do wonder is there anything that should be done for the mastermind, investigator, and Monster hunter, or just zealous loremasters that are going to be recalling knowledge on things that are pretty fully recognized? Especially for experienced players that sort of figure out some tropes about creatures? \n\nI guess demoralize and bon mot have diminishing returns as well but at least the Barbarian is using his skill every turn if he wants against oncoming repeat enemies."", ""I feel this is all very gamey.  Everyone knows werewolves are hurt by silver. I don't have to roll to know that.  I am all for having to figure out what sort of ghost it is, but not being able to recognize a creature that floats through walls and casts spells at me is a ghost is silly. This is one more way the rules are designed to make a system where one is not needed. For high levels, it makes more sense. \n\nI do like the repeat checks and your critical fail house rules."", 'I feel the like the solution to this problem should be to tag all creatures with 1  ""lore"" tag, which determine what lore skill can be used to recall knowledge about them. There should be a free action to look at the creature and asses it\'s general ""category"" which the tells the player what lore check applies. Then, PC\'s who are trained in that lore skill can attempt a recall knowledge check against the creature using the appropriate lore skill. Finally, there is a ""scale of understanding"" for the creature, which goes unknown -> familiar -> understood. Unknown means the PC knows nothing about the creature. Familiar means they know some things about it (AC? Max HP? Special actions?), and finally understood means they know the full stat block. Creatures start at unknown, and successful recall knowledge rolls bump this up one level, crits bump it up 2 levels and a failure means it doesn\'t move up. Players can keep a track of this state for each creature type they encounter, so they can RP going forwards in the game.', 'Just my 2 cents: I think the purpose of the skill check is to allow as many players/characters as possible to attempt Recall Knowledge. It\'s not that one character with multiple applicable skills uses the ""nature part"" of their brain to recall some info and the ""arcana part"" to recall different info, it\'s that a player with both skills can choose whichever is higher while characters with only one or the other can still make a check. \n\nAlso, I would suggest not to limit the skills to only creatures that fall under them. In the Bone Devil example, have the cleric roll. On a success, tell them that they don\'t recall any information about this creature (which might initially irritate the player, but the reasons for it will become clear, and, depending on how expert they are and how much confidence they have in their abilities, might even suggest to the player/character the reason; I can see the character furrowing their brow, muttering, ""Something isn\'t right here...""). On a critical success, though, tell them they have heard about this creature as it\'s certainly possible that in the study of the undead one might encounter warnings concerning creatures that are commonly confused with undead. It might not give the cleric an insight into a particular weakness (although it conceivably could), but it would let the cleric know they\'re not dealing with undead and prevent them from possibly wasting actions or endangering themselves or the party unnecessarily.\n\nEdited to add: And making the DC level-based as opposed to rarity-/obscurity-based has always seemed misguided to me. I don\'t use that aspect.', 'One thing I\'d like to point out is that in the example of the Bone Devil, the Cleric shouldn\'t be saying ""I will use Recall Knowledge with my Undead Lore skill"" and the GM then going ""Yeah, your Undead Lore skill tells you this isn\'t an undead; you don\'t know what it could be!"" as the text for Recall Knowledge states that the GM determines the DC and what skills are applicable. It stands to reason therefore that the player should be saying ""I\'d like to Recall Knowledge about this creature, what should I roll?"" and the GM would then *provide them with applicable skills from the main list of skills* (and the player could suggest a Lore they possess and ask if it could be used).\n\nWhile this might give the game away somewhat, as in the case of a Bone Devil, Undead Lore would not be on that list, which would give the player some information without making the check, it\'s just a core conceit of the game that everyone at the table separates what they as a player know from what their character knows, so I don\'t consider this to be a problematic result.\n\nSo in this scenario, the player would say ""Could I try to identify the creature, figure out what it is and any weaknesses or whatever?"", the GM would then say ""Alright, to identify it you\'ll need to roll me a secret Religion check"", and the player might say ""I have Undead Lore, could I use that instead?"" since perhaps they\'ve got a better proficiency with that skill, and the GM would say ""Undead Lore is not an applicable skill for this creature, I\'m afraid."" and play would continue with the player either opting to attempt the Religion check or not. The *player* knows that the creature isn\'t Undead (since why else would Undead Lore not be usable?), but the character is in the dark about it. \n\nAdditionally, it\'s mentioned in the rules for Recall Knowledge that ""You might know basic information about something without needing to attempt a check, but Recall Knowledge requires you to stop and think for a moment so you can recollect more specific facts and apply them."" Someone trained in Religion who sees a red-skinned, cloven-hoofed biped with horns and a humanoid shape can reasonably guess in-character that a creature is a Fiend of some kind, and it shouldn\'t take up one of the pieces of information from Recall Knowledge to confirm that if they\'re right; the information they get should build upon what they already know and be targetted toward things that are immediately useful.\n\nNow, to use the Bone Devil as an example again, if the player says ""That looks like a kind of Undead, what else can you tell me about it?"" and then rolls their character\'s Religion skill, then it\'s reasonable to use up one of the pieces of information to *correct their assumption* by saying like ""While this creature - known as an Osyluth - at first appears to be a kind of Undead, it is in fact a Devil born of the fifth layer of Hell: Stygia. Osyluths are known to be resistant to physical assaults, unless one wields a weapon with the properties of silver."" But if the player was fighting through the armies of Hell, they might reasonably assume it\'s just another Devil, and so you wouldn\'t use a piece of knowledge just to confirm something they can already infer from circumstance.']"

Late game in PF1e, an Alchemist(24 INT) could make up to 27 bombs, 39 Extracts, and 2 Mutagens\n\nIn PF2e, an Alchemist(18 INT) at level 1 has 5 Infused Reagents for 10 items average. Late game, Alchemists(22 INT) have have 26 Infused Reagents for an average of 52 Alchemical Items\n\nI actually find this to be balanced at each every level, with versatility and greater ease of crafting giving the win to the PF2e Alchemist, even when i low-balled them a bit. (What alchemist doesn\'t take a healthy of their research field Infusions?)\n\nBOMB VERSATILITY\n\nIn PF1e, you altered how your bombs worked with Feats, and if you didn\'t take any feats, you only had Fire damage. Most people chose 1 or 2 extra elements.\n\nIn PF2e, your bomb\'s basic function is in the formula book, and you have more freedom to target weaknesses.\n\nthat makes it much more versatile at every stage of the game in PF2e. And you can hand them out to your party for tactical use, something that isn\'t even an option in PF1e.\n\nATTACK ACCURACY\n\nIn PF1e, Alchemists are a 2/3s BAB class, similar to Rogues, Monks, and Magus.\n\nIn PF2e, Alchemists have Expert with Simple Weapons and their bombs and Master Class DC. Their comparative classes of Rogue, Monk, and Magus all got Master with their specific weapons as well as Class DC.\n\nHonestly, i think that in combat, Alchemists should be treated as Martials, and should have gotten the bump to Master/Master. Bombers throw bombs, Mutagenists and Poisoners need to hit with their attacks, and Chirugeons are usually next to the people taking damage.\n\n\nBOMB DAMAGE\n\nin PF1e, bombs scale in damage at 1d6 every 2 levels, same as the Rogue\'s Sneak Attack. They also added their INT to the On-Hit and splash damage of all Splash alchemical weapons. 1d6+4(5 splash) at low level, 10d6+7(17 splash) at high level.\n\nIn PF2e, damage of each bomb is severely reduced, both in base damage and with INT-scaling missing. \n\nDamage is lower in PF2e for sure. I think the INT to damage was replaced with the bonus damage they get from hitting a weakness. Rogues Sneak Attack was also nerfed. It feels bad, but that\'s game balance for you. \n\nOVERALL\n\nI would buff them to Master in their Weapons. That would be my only change, everything else seems ballpark equivilent to their old power comparisons. Maybe they thought that infinite crafting of ""alchemical spell slots"" was too strong?

Ranged damaged it's great if you got the chance to use it.

Love it"", ""When it comes to match ups I think higher level would be nicer cause HP is really low at early levels so characters can go down with a lucky roll. I think level 5 would be a good low level amount. There plenty of room to customize and it's the point at which most characters get their weapon skill increase along with the attribute boost. \n\nAs for format Martial vs Casters there are two issues, the first is obviously the Nova the caster's can do but the other is the support options that casters have. The supprt potential to buff/debuff and easily heal team mates can swing fights. Sure Martial can intimidate and Battle medicine but only once per combat though. If it's 4v4 I'd say have Mix teams with 2 Martial and 2 Caster on each team would be better. \n\nAs for arena events I think challenges would be better route to go and you can have multiple categories for the Challenge room. The players get a team and they have to fight wave after wave of monsters. Maybe some with no rest between waves, others with just short rest, but none with long rest. Each teams run can be ranked on how much Damage they took, how many waves they made it through, how many rounds it took to complete a wave, and etc. \n\nI think doing multiple categories will encourage people to build how they want rather than build to achieve fixed target. Like if you say the only measure is shortest number of rounds to victory you'll likely end up with a bunch of Nova oriented builds designed to do as much damage as possible in the first couple of rounds. Which also means you'll likely see a lot of similar builds as their tons of breakdowns online as to which class has the highest damage potential. \n\nBesides having multiple goals let people pick which one they wanna build towards or just build a more well rounded character as they know there is no fixed target. It also lets you highlight more people at the end of the challenge. Instead of a simple top 3, it's top 3 in each catagory as the team that maybe finished the waves the fastest ran out of steam a few waves in while another group lasted several waves. And things like who took the least amount of damage can highlight groups that focus on defense abilities and damage mitigation, which might result in them lasting longer but taking more rounds to win due to less damage output. \n\nBasically the goal is to encourage people to focus on the character type they want, rather than building to min/max a set achievement."", 'next time maybe just have one experienced player control each team with you as dm.']"

888,EmitEnoyAlQ,"[""At the PF2E subreddit, user Aeolas said very well what the experience of GMing PF2 is like. These points resonate doubly so when it comes to high-level play. Here is their post in full, which prompted a lively discussion:\n\nFrom https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/qbe6cz/the_one_thing_about_pf2e_that_makes_it_impossible/\n\nTHE ONE THING ABOUT PF2E THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GO BACK TO D&D5E IS...\n\nThe Combat Encounter Design rules. I've no idea what I was missing in my life.\r\n\r\nI'd played D&D5E since the launch of the core 3 books, and I consider myself a pretty good DM, but never once did the combat design rules there work for me. Instead, I learned to tread into the realm of adjusting numbers on the fly, lifting HP just a little higher to draw out the tension a little longer, letting a minion be quashed a little sooner when it wasn't of use, all in the name of letting my players have fun. But it was work for me, it felt like work, and by the end of my years in 5E, it felt like I was going through all this work, planning encounters haphazardly since I knew I could just adjust it on the fly, just to tell the story that I was eager to tell and that my players were eager for.\r\n\r\nFew weeks ago, I started Menace Under Otari, and I used the PF2 design rules website. 6 Giant Rats against 6 PCs. Moderate. I did my best. I flanked when I could. And by the end, it felt like a moderate fight.\r\n\r\nNext up. Giant Spider, and I added 2 spider swarms as per the rules. Again. I did the best I could. My spider swarms covered as many people as they could. My giant spider died to a lucky crit. Once again, it felt... moderately difficult.\r\n\r\nI didn't realise it until later, when I was reflecting on how the session went, that I realised that I got to have fun in combat. I could actually try my best! Use tactics! Flank! Aim for as many PCs as I could! I'd spent so many years pulling punches and softening blows that I'd forgotten what it really means to PLAY a game.\r\n\r\nWhat a blessing!"", 'This video makes me realize how much I appreciate the OSR.

Every annoying gimmick, poor design choice or minor thing that lessens suspension of disbelief I just need to fix. Especially at high and epic level there is always so much.

The campaign lasted for years! \nWe also played in Mystara for years, Old DnD converted to something like 3E...

890,p5xV7BOFwyw,"['I\'m only at the Ranger explanation now, and it still seems like it\'s a rotation. If you were to take the Greatsword, then yes you would take that melee option in 90% of the encounters. It\'s +12 damage and no other series of actions would be as worthwhile. The only time you would use the Longbow, is when the Greatsword would not work, which is just a longer rotation, because in all situations that Greatsword doesn\'t work you always switch to Longbow and do that rotation. If the third swing is not worth it, then instead of doing the third swing in the rotation you do another action you\'re good at instead. Similar to how the Swashbuckler did the same thing every single round.\n\nOn another note, In this scenario, if the Druid would have just cast Fireball it would have been over much faster. Honestly this entire example is dumb because the Druid did not use Fireball. He used the ""illusion of choice"" and intentionally nerfed himself in this encounter, which made the encounter far harder than it needed to be. What, was he thinking there would be 8 wights in the next room to save it? \n\nThen the AOO on the fighter would have been the optimal decision in encounter 2 to prevent the Wight from moving around, which means 1 less attack on the ranger and he would have blocked other wights from getting around. Instead due to the illusion of choice of forcing yourself to do a less than effective option the ranger took far more damage than they should have. The players also seemed to intentionally not focus targets which is the basic rule of tabletop. All of these choices are just intentional ways to nerf yourself to make the game seem like it has more depth than it does.', 'Im halfway through and a few thoughts...\n1 you compared the choices to 5e, which has notoriously few choices. If yiu want to make an honest effort to compare choices then compare it to 1e, 3.5 or some other system, with a mention about 5e having significantly fewer, and virtually all at level 1.\nThe player making the longbow attempt and the dm cinversation... not exactly a good dm if they badger a player aboit doing something new. I would argue for a simpler character if i had a dm badger me to do something different like that just to shut them up, even though i want choices. \nA character concept built thematically around a bowman  prefers ranged, alternative effective types of ranged attacks that function diffferently than just triggering 2-3 different abilities might be what a character is looking for. Like doing a series of ranged trip attacks rather than pure damage. Or some kind of attack on multiple targets with a lower attack bonus if the targets are grouped...', 'Whats the variance in the comments and what is reflective in actual game play?', 'This is a great video and example combat, but not a very convincing argument for the premise. \n\nThe examples given seem to show a few things:\n\na) the ranger can get out of her ideal rotation...if she gives up her core character concept of being a ranged DPS attacker a\'la legolas - just use a great sword and run into melee!  This is a disheartening answer to a player with an idea of how they want to RP. \n\n2. The swashbuckler can do basically the same things, just don\'t be dumb and stand in the middle of the enemies.  Also they\'ll decide to stop attacking you in the second scenario because reasons.  \n\n3. The druid again can be useful so long as they don\'t do the thing that seems fun to them - being a big bear.   Maybe party comp should have discussed whether this was his role or not, but it again seems to be pigeonholing the characters. \n\nAgain, this was super educational and interesting to watch; I just didn\'t find the specific combat example convincing as to whether there\'s ""illusion of choice""', 'I\'ve been watching your back catalog as a GM trying to beef up on PF 2e. I\'m curious about the following detail: the ranger needs to make a flat check to reload when grabbed. As far as I can see, only pg 279 of the core rules refers to reload, and the reload entry indicates how many interact actions are needed. A longbow has ""0"". It doesn\'t say free action; it\'s not an action at all. The only action taking place is strike action, which doesn\'t have the manipulate trait, but does include reloading. I think RAW here suggests you shouldn\'t need a flat check in that situation. Is there something I\'m missing?', ""watching you do simulated combat reminds me of old television where an artist draws a sketch, or paints on a canvas.\n\nyou're like bob ross for tabletop games and i love it."", 'Love the channel.

This makes me feel that if you don\'t pick Magic Missile (S tier) then what are you doing?\r\n\r\nWith so many situational feats and spells that don\'t do anything, selecting a spell from any of the lower tiers is the equivalent of a voluntary flaw with no benefits?\n\nThoughts?', 'It\'s awesome to see such in-depth content showing tactics, feats, and option in combat- great work! Something I try to remember as a DM is that if my players feel like they\'re trapped into doing the same things session after session, then half of that is on me to design more diverse encounters. For instance, making the objectives of combat not always just ""kill the monsters"", but introduce other facets based on the party\'s skills and feats to keep them on their toes. For instance, making them have to stop a ritual where killing all the bad guys doesn\'t stop the progress, and building in ways to stop it based on the party\'s skills and feats.', 'Interesting to note that all of this is done on a relatively simple battlefield, in somewhat close range. In extremely close combat (say, in a room), the ranger\'s option obviously changes. If someone kicks over a table and use it as an impromptu cover against the ranger, that math also changes. Tactics change even in a simple room brawl, and it seems ill-advised to simply go ""I have this optimal strategy"". None of them considered much to assist one another until Recall Knowledge by the druid (I think, it\'s a long video and I am somewhat inebriated), which can also change the flow of combat and what one might call optimal. I really wouldn\'t think that PF2e is a game that one would use ""MMO rotation"" on, ahaha!', 'Sorry, my dude, your example with Huntee Shot absolutely proves the First Order Optimal Strategy problem with pf2.

Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 1E came out in 1977, 2E AD&D(still basically the same mechanical game so sticking true to the word ""edition"") came out in 1989 and lasted until 2000. The ADVANCED iteration of the game lasted for 23 years, longer than all these WotC editions COMBINED!

Now they have this new... thing coming in 2024 that is likely to be much more of an overhaul than they want to admit, as you point out, so they still sell their stuff! I have heard another person, one who actually liked 4E as it catered to the style of play he prefers, who has talked about how hard it is to actually play 4E because the errata wasn\'t actually released, and the ones that were are no longer on the D&D site(I believe), but it was put onto... D&D Insider, I think it was called, and that was shut down when 5E was released basically killing the edition unceremoniously so people can\'t say ""Well YOU can choose to keep playing it if you want!"" because the rules aren\'t good and the fixes aren\'t available if you haven\'t painstakingly made sure they are backed up somewhere!\n\nThis was a lot to say that I, a long time player and fan of D&D, no longer really care what this game does!

I haven’t played 5e so I can’t really compare. I can say is that all the rules seem well thought out and fair though. Ironically this can be a problem for new players if the table lets it become a problem.

I could feel this happening both to me and to the other new players in my group. \n\nWe ended up having a discussion and agreed that the first time we come up with something wild the GM will make up a ruling on the fly and we will put a pin on it to figure precisely how it should work later.\n\nThe GM even puts a little bias in favor of the player because he thinks there should be a reward for coming up with things that he is not prepared for to encourage and reward creativity. \n\nThis has made a huge difference on our table and I highly recommend the same for people new to the game.', ""A very clear and disgestable comparison, thankyou!

I've been following your Pathfinder sample combats for a while, and I really enjoy the way you're making some of the more complex systems more approachable for beginners!\n\nWhile soaking up new knowledge about alternative 3rd actions, I think I caught a mistake in your Trip effectiveness calculation (it should be -0.28 on average, I believe):\nYour example stated a net gain of +0.2 (+0.12 with the fail chance), however, you also reduced the negative effect on Char A in the process by the same amount, as if they wouldn't be gaining the multiple attack penalty, in case they failed the trip.\n\nIf you attempt to trip (failure or not), you will always have the -0.7 deficit. So, assuming failure 40% of the time would actually look like this (in my opinion):\n\nFailure: (-0.7 + 0 + 0 + 0) * 0.4 = -0.28\nSuccess: (-0.6 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.2) * 0.6 = 0.06\n\nWhich, summed up, makes the net result a -0.22.\nTo my understanding, you trade the potential damage increase + enemy debuff for (on average) lower damage in this specific szenario. I'm not sure if Trip is a viable option here, but it might just be, dependent on context.\n\nDemoralize has no negative influence on yourself, while the negative effect of Tripping as an Attack applies to Char A - regardless of the outcome.\nHTH :)"", ""I don't like you demoralze example.

Raising a shield is quite good by the math here, it's hard to imagine using my third action for anything else when I have one.

You could use the  arcane recovery equivalent on a short rest to recover some ""mana"".  And of course it cost more to upcast.  Just about any system would be better than spell slots.  It turns people away from playing wizard because its always been far to restrictive.  Of course all this ignores the terrible action economy of pathfinder 2e.  Because its fun that almost every spell cost 2 actions.  Even cantrips.  Your only hope as a  wizard is to spend your actions to hope to get into range and then hope you were lucky enough to prepare the right spell for the encounter.', ""This is good to know. One piece of feedback though, it would've helped illustrate it to have a complete example - what a level 4 wizard with and without flexible spellcasting prepares and what they cast during the day."", 'Another thing from older editors not many mention is that prepared casters could leave slots open. In other words not prepare a spell in this slot, during the day you could then later prepare a spell in that slot taking 10 min/spell level. So say you level a 3rd level slot and now want to prepare a spell in that slot it take 30 min to prepare a 3rd level spell in that slot. Another thing, all slots can prepare any spell of that level or lower. This doesn\'t mean the spell is a higher spell level at all, just you used that slot for a spell. For instance, you could use that same 3rd level spell for a 1st level spell. \n\nNext, metamagicnin one is is SUPERB. You can do so many things and ANY caster can take metamagic as they are feats. I prefer 1e overall because it is so capable in cool diverse characters to the max, however it can be quite daunting for new players. I played D&D3.0 on release, 3.5, AD&D, Pathfinder 1e on release, and same with 2e. I have run almost all those versions too. I am well experienced in each and have a lot of Pathfinder 1e memorized because of my vast experience. There is many honebrew rules used, and I have made to make it a better experience. I like both, 2e for trimming down some waste from the old, but 1e for the pure shenanigans I see my players can do. The cool concepts, outlandish items and spells to the max. \n\nAlso, spells in 1e automatically ""heightened"" so to spell. A lot of the dice, spell range, duration was based on caster level not what spell level it was cast at. DC was based off of spell level, not caster level. Thus it is 10+ability score+spell level. So first level spell (even if cast in higher slots) is always 10+ability score+1. The ONLY exception is the heighten spell metamagic which make the spell require a higher slot equal to the level you are trying to cast it at. So say you Heightened the 1st level spell to 3 you need to use a 3rd level slot as it adds 2 to the spell level slot. All metamagic works this way. Maximize spell, for instance, adds +3 to spell level slot required. This means the 1st level spell needs a 4th level slot, this does not increase the spells level though only the slot it must use. Maximize spell means you don\'t roll and dice, they are all at maximum value. You can use multiple metamagic too. So, 1st level spell Maximize, empower, still, silent, heightened 2. This makes it do max damage, 50% more damage, have no somatic components, no verbal components and is considered a 3rd level spell for DC and any other purpose based on spell level.\n\n\nIt is fun....', 'Hello, could you explain how spellcasting multiclassing works?

The second Strike will take either a –5 penalty if you use the longsword or a –4 penalty if you use the shortsword.

Not for those who want detailed mechanics for abilities or character progression.', ""I have played the Sentinels RPG for over a year now, and I can say its one of the best RPGs out there.\nIt does somewhat depend on what sort of playstyle you prefer: \n1.) It is more crunchy than it may initially seem, but its not as crunchy as something like Mutants and Masterminds or Pathfinder.\n2.) The GM tends to be on the player's side, but it could be played to be more antagonistic, with cruel twists when the heroes fail to stop the bad things from happening.\n3.) Player characters never really die without the player's consent, so if you are looking for a darkest dungeon/meat-grinder feeling, you need to modify the rules to make it work.\n \nTo summarize, it allows for a lot of different playstyles, but if you want something with lots of crunchy mechanics, want something where its very Players vs GM, or want something where the PCs die often, you may want to look elsewhere.\nThat said, I feel like it CAN do each of these to some extent, and is flexible enough to be enjoy by a wide range of people.

My group loved making the characters and having to build the backstory in such a great way. Even if you have no idea what to play (like I did) I built an incredibly cool character with a cool backstory.  If you're looking for a superhero RPG, give it a look."", 'It\'s probably worth noting that the game is mechanically independent from the included setting.  You can easily play in your own homebrew world, outright steal one from another RPG like M&M or Champions or Masks, or use a published comic line like Marvel or DC as your setting.  The rules are versatile enough to port character concepts in pretty easily, and the different mechanics can give a fresh feel to familiar settings.  For ex, you can use the SCRPG to play a much lighter, less crunchy version of the Champions universe (and boy, beating up VIPER minions is a lot quicker here) or use Mask\'s Halcyon City for a game with a bit more mechanical crunch and less of a narrow focus on the teen-hero-coming-of-age theme.\n\nI\'d also contend that (like so many reviews of this game) you\'re mistaken about a lack of character growth.  The SCRPG actually has three forms of it.  The retcons and tweaks that you mentioned change your character without greatly amplifying their overall abilities (although they\'re often used to achieve better team synergies and just plain improved efficiency).  The hero points you earn each session and use in the next one offer considerable short-term bonuses, and add quite a bit of flavor when using the ""alternate rewards"" options on page 248-249.  And the ""collections"" you earn every ~6 sessions are the game\'s version of levelling up.  They offer a slew of once/session options going forward that dramatically increase the power of your hero, either by maximizing dice, ignoring twists (which lets you use abilities from higher in the GYRO tier early, among other things), and making narrative changes by adding elements to the scene.  They don\'t seem amazing at first, but once you accumulate even three or four your hero is much more consistently capable and has loads of options that a new hero lacks.\n\nYour capabilities don\'t grow as fast as (say) a D&D character going from 1st to 2nd level, but they do improve.  The impact of collections will eventually lead to the GM having to bump up scene difficulties to compensate - or encourage players to consider putting their uber-heroes in semi-retirement and try something new, with the powerhouses coming out to play for big events where their full power is needed.  The highest collection total I\'ve heard of was an average of 12 per hero (representing over a year and half of fairly steady play with the same heroes) and the GM in that game has had to modify his prep work considerably to allow for their massively improved capabilities.', ""Thanks for the video!

It comes up quite a bit in tables I frequent.\n\nReduce, remove and ignore are simple enough, but mitigate is such a broad term, it can easily apply to anything that opposes a curse effect. I’m going to give examples that I wouldn’t blame anyone from considering it as curse mitugation, but I’m just not sure if it’s intended.\n\n1. Many curses grant either penalties or bonuses to a variety of stats. Would an opposing bonus or penalty count as mitigation? Would a curse initiative penalty prevent you from increasing initiative with a bonus? Would a curse attack roll bonus prevent you from decreasing the attck roll with a penalty?\n\n2. Bones and Tempest curses grant a resistance and a weakness respectively. Would a curse poison resistance mean you can’t gain a poison weakness? Would a curse electricity weakness mean you can’t gain an electricity resistance?\n\nFor these numerical oppositions, I personally just add them up together as normal when I GM. They aren’t directly altering the benefit/drawback; they just happen to affect the same stat (ex. a curse penalty to AC isn’t directly reduced by wearing armor that adds AC). However, not everybody sees it that way and will still count it as mitigation. Either way, I really want to know what the devs actually intended for this.\n\nThere are other weird ones that aren’t purely numerical that get even more controversial. Cosmos curses you with enfeebled which penalizes your STR rolls and DCs. Would gaining a bonus to athletics count as mitigation here? Even with the bonus, you’re still enfeebled, but the bonus does undeniably alleviate the penalty. Would Assurance Athletics count as mitigation? It completely changes the roll/check formula to only include proficiency, but it doesn’t directly oppose enfeeble.\n\nAnyway, keep up with the videos!

Does it happen immediately, processing all of the fall distance that can occur during a round right then and at the beginning of every subsequent round?  Or is the distance evenly divided among every creature's turn that round?\n\nFor abilities that interact with the next or previous action like meta magic or the magus' arcane cascade: Do those carry over to the next turn assuming I'm not taking any free actions or reactions between turns?  Does this work differently for monster abilities like grab or push?\n\nWhat happens if a creature Stands up from being prone and a monk critically hits it with a Stand Still reaction triggered by this Stand?\n\nCan you manually leave a stance?

This gives them standard cover but is implied without any actions dedicated to it, which I think lines up with the vision of grid-based turn-based combat being a simplified version of what's narratively a chaotic mess with lots of small movements. Take Cover in this case upgrades to greater cover as normal, not necessarily breaking line of effect because in the non-turn-based narrative it's possible to catch the taker-of-cover as they're leaning in or out. Valeros/the green goblin here would essentially gain no cover-related benefits because in a situation where the other creature is attacking them (the default state of leaning out), they're completely exposed to their attacker. \nThat took a bit to explain but in practice it went over as pretty intuitive, eliminates the need for leaning as an action, and keeps cover strong which I think feels good for the players (and in the moment helped an overestimated encounter break at least a tiny sweat).

I know description of aid is very blurry, but this description is a bit too lenient. \nPf 2e  rules could usually be understood by reverse engineering. I think here one good point is the assisting shot feat.\nThis fighter feat makes use a ranged attack on your turn, to give attack bonus to your friend, next attacking that creature. \nSounds familiar? Yep its an upgraded aid, since you use a ranged attack. Now this clarifies a lot.\n1. In aid description it says GM is to attach trait to the preparatory and the reaction, so both would be attack. \nNow ready action clarifies that in such a case, the reaction does have MAP! \nLook if aid had no MAP assisted shot had no point at all. Also logically it is strange, that you use 2 action to ready attack and you keep MAP and you clearly put a trigger which may not happen, but with aid you use a single action, and trigger is quite simple.\nSo my understanding aid works same way as ready. The action you traded for reaction has MAP, so your reaction does have it too.\nAoO works differently, but first thats a hard to get feat  for martial PCs (not free for all), which can be avoided, \nsecond AoO mechanics is completly differently you do not ""trade in"" anything. \n2.  This also means that for example if you aid your friend in a shove or trip attack that has MAP too, same with aiding escape. \n3. Keeping MAP is logical by the way, since MAP shows that you loose focus as you have done lot more. \nNot logical that when you ready (with concentrate trait) and spend 2/3 of your round on it, you get MAP, but not with aid.\n4. assisting shot also explains us what would be the DC for attackers aid. That is the AC. In fact extinsion curse campaign has this costar action, which works same way as aid, and clarifies that your DC is the DC of the action your friend does take.\n5. So yes if you want to ""disturb"" an enemy who is good at defending himself then its harder to disturb too. \nIf you want to aid your friend to tie up a wounded finger its much easier than to aid him in brain surgery. \nSo as rules say, easy task are easy to aid, hard tasks are hard to aid.\nTo summerize aid is useful, but I think if you play by RAW, you would not get to this automatic crit successes. \nOtherwise as I said assisting shot (a hard to get martial feat!) is nonsense, and aid is way outbalanced. \nBut its true, rules are blurry and just hint to what is written above.

While it might be nice to have an attempt at knocking it free that also gives a bonus to other attempts, it doesn't stack with Aid, which is a higher bonus. Which is fine I guess. That bonus comes at the cost of an action and a reaction and can't Disarm so it's kinda situationally worse than just trying for one yourself (unless the target goes right after you, then maybe Aid is better for followup), but still.

Could it be the target of Spirit Object hex or TKP? Or if an enemy spend one action to pick it up, is it now attended? Or is it grab?

Or would the enemy have to use a Grab maneuver?\n\nI was thinking that there’s a problem if the familiar being a creature/object is an “EITHER/OR” case. But now I’m thinking it might be a “BOTH/AND”: Both a creature and an object, so the DM would have to rule which rule is more applicable.

True, Gary did incorporate a Law/Chaos continuum into the original game (inspired at least in part by Three Hearts and Three Lions), but it wasn't until AD&D that good and evil entered the mix and we got a 2D matrix"", 'I agree that altruism defines Good, but argue that selfishness likewise defines Evil.  Lots of people would help a stranger if it didn\'t cost them too much.  Many will also see to their own _wants_ before the _needs_ of others.  In both cases, it\'s a matter of degree, leaving most people as Neutral on that axis.  ""Live & let live"" is the Neutral minimum for existing in a stable society, it\'s not enough to make one Good.  Failing to get involved in volunteering or charity isn\'t enough to make one Evil, but contibuting to the ill-being of others for one\'s own well-being may be.  In terms of the Good and Neutral alignments who recognize the value of morality, I tebd to think of Deontology as the LG moral philosophy because it holds that rules and duties will create Good, and Consequentialism is more CG because it\'s the result that matters, not the process.  Those who see some value and some flaws in either end of that spectrum may be interested in Virtue Ethics, because it focuses on creating a sense of good through practice and consideration of choices in a case-by-case basis.  The neutrals won\'t go far out of their way to help others if the risk or cost seems high, and they often feel like ""not Evil"" is a sufficient definition of Good.\nEvil only cares about the concept of morality insofar as it serves their needs.  LE can use an ordered power structure to get what they want, and benefit from other\'s tendency to confuse ""law"" and ""good"" as synonyms.  NE will lie to appear Good, but they\'re gaslighting.  CE dispenses with the steps of manipulating a structure or carefully constructing lies, and will indulge their own whims, and dare others to ""come at me"" to get away with it.\n\nBatman is everyone\'s favorite example in a discussion/argument about alignment because there are cases in which the character has been all of them.  Sometimes he\'s putting himself at great risk to save others, sometimes seeking to \'fight crime\' for his own enjoyment of violence, sometimes becoming a fascist dictator putting structure and personal power far ahead of others\' well-being, and in a couple cases, causing as much mayhem and destruction as The Joker typically does, though those tend to be an alternate-universe versions of the character.', 'I like to think of lawful as principled and chaotic as unprincipled and neutral is the gray area in between \n\nIt doesn’t make sense that a LG Paladin would have the principle of not lying be so important to actually not lie to a known evil character. That is more in line with lawful neutral. Also, just because you’re LG doesn’t even mean you have the principle of not lying either. There are many good principles and not all lawful good characters encompass every single one, especially not to the T.\n\nSome food for thought to avoid the classically annoying lawful stupid stereotypes. Yes even LG has nuance.', 'its facinating to see you state that if a charakter has both alignment the moralety spectrum trumphs the order spectrum. i have a champion-tyrant in my game that i\'d esaly call LE but she\'d take an order from a superior or the impied ""intent"" of a vaugely written law annyome over her own inclination to enslave, torture and humiliate for her own enjoyment/benefeit anny time.', 'I think a character who takes the opposite trajectory from Walter White and travels the alignments from evil to good is Vegeta.

I arrived at this very idea and system a few years ago. It makes very good sense to think of HP this way. In my version after hit points are reduced to zero, you have lost the ability to adequately defend yourself from harm. All that remains are your Life Points. These are comprised of all your ability scores added together and then divided by the number of different score categories. Once a character reaches zero HP they are unable to defend themselves from receiving permanent and potentially fatal damage. Damage to Life Points could lead to reduced ability scores, such as lowered intelligence from head injuries, or reduced charisma score because of massive scars. Damage to Life Points could be spread among a characters ability scores, affecting all of them. Or it could only affect a single ability score. It could lower a dexterity score because of suffering a near crippling injury. Shoulder or arm injuries could reduce a characters strength ability. Any damage to Life Points are permanent and cannot be gained back once they are lost. Only a Wish, or something rising to that level- such as Divine intervention- can restore a characters Life Points, returning them to normal. Players nearing zero HP must decide to continue combat and risk permanent damage, or disengage, flee, or surrender.  \n\n“Goran winced in pain with every step he took. But there was nothing he could do about it. His right leg had been badly broken years ago during his adventuring days. The bones were so badly damaged that they could not be set properly, and they did not heal as they should have, even with a potion. Because of it he was forced to retire from adventuring. He used a crutch but it was little help and did nothing to alleviate the pain. Every day he lamented to himself about his life changing decision to fight the Ogre far longer than he should have. He wished that he had made a better choice and disengaged the monster instead of bravely standing his ground until the brute rag-dolled him against a tree, and then a boulder, and then the tree again, until finally flinging him away, discarding his limp body like a soiled blanket.”', ""This is a system I developed in 1987 , it's based of of size race constitution and more importantly keeping the game interesting as ones character increases in levels . First a race needs to be determined for a character this will put the hit points in a size range small medium large there is also extra large but that's more for creatures than characters .\nSmall being 0-3' Medium 3'- 8' Large 8'-18' and ExLarge 18'+\nHit points being based off of a 1d12 per ft with -1hp per dice for S. a +1hp per dice L. and a +2hp per dice for ExL. M. receives no penalty or bonus.\n Racial Adjustment\nHuman no adjustment, Halfling a -1per hp dice , Half Elf -1-2per hp dice , Elf -1-3per hp dice , Gnomes no adjustment this is based off of their hardiness off setting their small stature this brings us to Dwarves +1-6per hp dice and half orcs +1-2per hp dice adjustment . Now one will say well this is fine and dandy for characters but what about creatures will this is where your experience and skills of a DM comes into play , there's a reason people are joining you for a game they trust your expertise and honesty to make appropriate calls on adjustments in figuring HP's and damage for example a battalion of archers that's a 1000 men raining a 1000 arrows down on a dragon isn't going to do anything even though one arrow could kill a human . So don't be lazy this system will give your game a much more realistic feel so take the time to figure HP's for creatures at first this will be time consuming but once your used to it it will be more like second nature a quick judgement on size and hardiness of the creature and boom you'll know an appropriate number.\n So in figuring a S. character 1d6+or-, M no more than 1d8+or-, L no more than 1d10+or-, ExL no more than 2d20+or- such creatures as dragons \n HP Adjustment for Strength\n3-7 strength -1hp per point below an 8 \n8-14 strength no adjustment\n15-18/50 +1 HP per point over 14 no additional until a score of 18/51 - 18/99 an additional+1 and a score of 18/00 +2 \n  HP Adjustment for Constitution\n3-7 -1per point under a score of 8 \n8-14 no adjustment\n15-18 +2 HP per point over the score of 14 . \nHP Adjustment Based off of Sex\nMales none females - 1d6 but +1d6  for Charisma . \nNow what makes this so different and challenging is that first your players actually have the ability to make it past 1st level because they start off with substantial HP's secondly it's based of of something that actually makes sense in the game and finally once a character hits 6th level he/she better be using their witt's because your HP's don't adjust. Less the DM has adjusted them permanently for some reason. So there ain't no having 13th level fighter having a 130+ HP's ! \n Submitted for your consideration please let me know your thoughts I would love a critique. Speaking of a critique I obviously jumped the gun with your system !

1277,PlAXLedJiTk,"[""Charisma is best in the beginning for divine font, but Wisdom becomes more important around level 10, due to needing to heal more hit points. I tend to work on high Charisma and Dex with Cloistered, and high Charisma and Str with Warpriest. Wisdom is secondary in the beginning, but I add to Wisdom over other abilities. By level 20, my clerics tend to have higher Wisdom than other abilities. I did create one that leveled in Charisma and Wisdom up into abilities 22 and 21 by end of game - took Bard Archetype at 2nd. I took one and leveled him up in Wisdom and Strength, and left Charisma alone after my initial ability in it at 18. I archetype in Marshall with this character. I did make a high wisdom build with only a 16 Charisma and took Medic as archetype. This didn't work as well as a healer, overall. With my high Charisma builds, I am able to keep my party alive in the lower levels, and then able to work on buffs as I level. There are feats you can take that will also buff up characters as you heal them... radiant infusion and heroic recovery are two. So many ways you can build a good cleric, still heal, and still be effective in other ways. You can hurt undead with channels, and fiends too if you take the feat that allows you to channel good energy to harm fiends. Clerics are enjoyable. I still think I like Pathfinder 1e Clerics best. And I like the rituals in DnD 5E more.\n\nFeats I recommend for Cloistered (my preferred Cleric): Toughness, Holy Castigation, Radiant Infusion (1d6 postive energy to those you heal helps to overcome certain resistances), Heroic Recovery, Reach, Directed Channel (at least if you are cloistered - and wanna stay at a distance), Selective Energy (comes so late, but is so important to three action channels - especially ones with the 30 ft radius), Holy Light, Defense Recover, Fast Channel (comes so late, but important), Swift Banishment (this saved our party so many times), Eternal Blessing (decent enough), maybe Resurrectionist (but the trick is to not let anyone die to begin with - but sometimes it is impossible to keep everyone alive, even with spells - due to death spells like phantasmal force), any 20th level feat is impressive. If you run into a great deal of elementals, i believe tehre is a feat that allows you to harm elementals with your channels. \n\nWarpriests are great, but if you are healing, you will likely do very little fighting, if the gm takes it hard on you, anyway. Or if you play any of the Adventure Paths - where each encounter is either a normal battle, hard battle, or extreme battle. Adventure Paths do not make the level extreme, they make two or more creatures you fight extreme. Rest is important, but in a dungeon, that might not always be easy. So... Warpriests will not be able to fight very often, unless someone else in the party is a healer.\n\nI have not played as an evil cleric. Just evil monk and evil wizard."", 'You have, in general, high charisma so I generally recommend building a bit in intimidation.

I’m genuinely sorry about that.  But I feel my points and reasoning all hold true.  Handing off this build as you’ve created it to a player playing a one-off adventure at level 20 makes perfect sense.  I think anything other than that, and a player is going to want to boost their Constitution & Wisdom scores, as those are used in nearly every gaming session, and in every battle.  Obviously there are exceptions, such as for characters with a much more MAD build.  Like a support Bard that also takes Enigma muse for Bardic Lore.  Cutting back on Wisdom for a bit more  Intelligence makes some sense there.  Especially since the Bard’s already strong Will & Perception proficiencies can help mitigate the loss..  I would encourage you to explain in future build videos the reasoning behind your decisions for the ability score increases at each stage.  It’s important for new and/or inexperienced players watching the video to understand why you make those decisions….  Also, I’m not sure how much of a stickler you are for the rules, but I encourage you to let players with builds like this adjust their ability scores at level 20 if they ask and everyone at the table agrees.  In practical terms, it’s going to matter very little at the table at that level.  I’m all for the concept of options, and making tough choices for a character throughout one’s adventuring career.  But I also consider it bad game design that when a player reaches the top level in the game, one can be met with the possibility of “dead” or useless ability score increases all because the player chose survivability for the five levels prior.  Each class already has a strange mix of mostly underwhelming level 20 feat options, where the best ones are often so good it rarely makes sense to take the super-niche ones or the weaker ones.  Many classes don’t even get a level 20 class feature.  Letting the players add a few extra ability score increases—which would be going towards otherwise mostly untouched scores—helps provide a boost (in spirit, more than anything) to what is often a pretty underwhelming experience that Paizo clearly failed at during the game design stages.', 'At 15th level, why would a player increase their Strength & Intelligence on a Bard character built like this?  I assume it’s so at level 20 there are no “wasted” ability boosts, allowing you to fully maximize all ability boosts.  I get this in theory, and as a character build for a player starting at level 20, this makes total sense.  However, if you’re suggesting these builds as something for a player to use when starting at level 1, it will be much more beneficial, in-game, for a character to take their 18s in both Constitution & Wisdom over Strength and Intelligence.  And yes, that basically leaves you with two useless ability score increases at level 20.  But I mean, you’re level 20, the last character level for most games.  But at least the player using this build would get FIVE full levels of increased Con & Wisdom stats.  That means the player gets an increased stat for things like Hit points, Perception, and any skills/skill feats they have using Wisdom (such as Medicine).  But more importantly, the player gets FIVE levels of increased saving throws for both their Fortitude saves & Will saves.  So in practical terms, why would a player with this build ever increase their Strength & Intelligence scores prematurely?  So they get five levels of a near-useless Strength bump & an almost equally useless Intelligence bump, all at the cost of less survivability?  And you’re doing that just so you can have a “prettier” set of scores at level 20?  But even at level 20, isn’t that extra +1  to Intelligence mod still next to useless?  What are you doing differently at level 20 where you suddenly need that extra +1 on your Recall Knowledge checks, the extra language, and the extra trained skill?..  I’m all for a more balanced character, but not at the cost of actual table-play survivability.  I’ve actually been lucky enough to DM multiple high-level games since PF2Es inception.  Never once at those important levels of 15-19 have I ever heard the support-focused  players at my table express disappointment that their decision to maximize their most important Saving Throw stats over picking up that +1 to Strength & Intelligence for those extra five levels.  As support characters, the best ability is dependability; You can’t help anyone if an enemy has taken you out of the battle.']"

Ancient elf gives the multiclass feat.', 'Love me a good Necromancer build. \n~ Adam', ""Just wanted to warn you that this build has one thing thats technically against the rules/illegal. Since the build multiclasses into Cleric rather than being a Cleric, you cannot use multiclass feats to grab Cleric feats that have Harm Font as a prerequisite, such as Command Undead, because the multiclass feats specify that you still need to meet the prerequisites of Cleric feats you take with them, and since the only way to have Harm Font is the base class features of the cleric class (dedication dose NOT give it to you) you can basicly never take feats with Harm Font (or heal font, for that matter) as a prerequisite with Cleric multiclass feats.\n\nAs a result, I think Witch dedication would be SIGNIFICANTLY better than Cleric dedication here. Witch is Int-based like Wizard, meaning you can start with a lower Wisdom which would help your stat lineup IMMENSELY since your so MAD due to wanting to take Cha but also needing Wis for Cleric. Witch can be divine if you choose Fervor for your patron, so it still nets you Harm. You lose Death's Call by going Witch, yes, but gain two massive things. The first is Cackle, which amounts to 1-3 more free sustains/fight, which is pretty huge. \n\nThe second is that you get a familiar that regenerates on a daily prep after dying instead of one week. Once you take Cackle via Basic Witchcraft, it also upgrades to have just enough powers to make it a undead familiar (rolling head), which means you can sacrifice it each day to Seplachural Sublimation to get a free slot *of your highest level*....this is also pretty huge, just like cackle, and overall makes Witch just flat out better than Cleric as a multiclass here due to the Harm Font thing preventing you from grabbing Command Undead.\n\nAlso, as an alternative idea, since a lot of these spells you took are also divine, have you considered trying this build with a Undead Bloodline Sorcerer instead of a Wizard? You'd get almost all the spells you want while still having the same top level slots/day as a wizard and access to effortless concentration (which a Cleric or Oracle wouldn't) since your not taking spell blending, but would not have to multiclass into Cleric to get Harm, which would help a TON. Divine also has a bunch of great Teamwork spells arcane lacks, like Heroism and even Heal, assuming your with a party of breathers rather than undead party members.\n\nYou lose Call of the Grave, yes, but gain Undeath's Blessing, which lets you use Harm to heal a single ally, and with an enhanced healing effect, which helps with Teamwork at low levels. Having the free archetype opened up could let you dip into something else to support your party, like say Medic (if you want to be a sort of plague doctor/healer-type) or possibly a Witch multiclass to pick up Cackle + the undead familiar to use with Seplachural Sublimation. Since this build likely won't want to take casting out of witch due to being Cha based and not Int-based,  you even have room to go into Lich at high levels if you wanted, which is pretty darn cool."", 'Your Fear Tyrant build is my new favorite character.

Those are: prepared casters, spontaneous casters, classes that only cast focus spells, and the way the magus and summoners cast spells. I\'m calling this one ""gish casting"", mostly because I can\'t come up with a better name (and I don\'t like calling it ""half-casting"").\nWe also have two ways casters get their magical tradition: they either choose one or get one of the four assigned to them.\nAll in all, we have\nFor Prepared Casters: Multitradition: Witch; Arcane: Wizard; Divine: Cleric; Primal: Druid\nFor Spontaneous Casters: Multitradition: Sorcerer; Divine: Oracle; Occult: Bard\nFor Focus Casters: Multitradition: Monk (actually just Divine or Occult); Divine: Champion; Primal: Ranger\nFor Gish Casters: Multitradition: Summoner; Arcane: Magus\n\nSo there are a couple missing, you can guess where I\'m going with this. To be honest, I doubt Paizo is going to fill the Focus Casters roles, so I\'m going to ignore them.\n\nTrying to fill those slots with classes from PF1e: Prepared Occult: Occultist; Spontaneous Arcane: Arcanist; Spontaneous Primal: Shaman; Divine Gish: Inquisitor; Occult Gish: Skald; Primal Gish: Bloodrager\nIt\'s not perfect for sure, and there are more spellcasters from PF1e than those, but those are my guesses.\n\nIf I have to guess the next two classes, assuming both are casters, I would think they share some theme.

And so that the Divine spell help. But I'll give it more since spellcasting it's often all about the spells anyway and Divine it's the second best team spellist for me, just behind the Occultist.\n\n- I agree that most people will take fighter to just whack a sword and deal damage, but for me he is one of the best team work martials! Trip, shove and frightening foes, archer fighter have a ranged Aid. I often the GM, but when I played, I played a 1 Weapon one Free hand fighters Full Team Support!! I was making monsters Flatfooted and Frightened permanently, so my party could hit and crit them more often.\n\n\n- My investigator is in a kinda mistery campaign, and even though most of it's team work are about Diplomacy.\n\n- For Wizard and Sorcerer I would give a bigger grade. All their team work comes from spell? Yes, but most of caster get everything from spells, and Arcane it's great for team work. My Wizard do this in 2 ways, a Major Combo buffing the barbarian damage to the sky with magic weapon (at leat until he gets one for him self) and using undeads to trip, shove and flank enemies.\n\n- I would give Druid the lowest teamwork of casters. Primal Spell list it's the less teamwork spellist for me, just having Heal.\n\n- Cleric it's a monster healer. But divine spellist really helps with things like Forbidding Ward and Guidance. But I would give it the same score.\n\n- Witch is a really good teamwork class. I love the Occult spell list.\n\n- Champion it's one of the best teamwork classes for me.\n\n- My Barbarian it's a Giant Instinct, so his teamwork it's just using Demoralize.

I predicted support magic was going to be at the top of the list (under only the alchemist) but since the archtypes are so easy and good that might make the point somewhat less impactful since most characters can pick up at least a couple of support spells if they are inclined.  Rogues are OP in almost every way but that does not make them good at teamwork.  The rogue gets plenty from others but rarely gives as much back as a half way decent support caster.  Bard and Champion are also 80% support abilities which means they are beneath only the alchemist at teamwork (but yes is not the move).', ""Good video. I think teamwork is vital in PF2.

This project has been incredibly taxing.\n\nThank you."", ""Death system: Way simpler in 5E, but also makes going into dying nearly irrelevant since you can be brought back up immediately with a heal. \nPF2 makes dropping to 0 very deadly. \nMost people even handwave the fact that you drop everything from your hands when you go unconscious. So if you use both hands in combat, whether it's a sword and a shield or two weapons, you're gonna need all three actions to get back into battle, and even then you may need to stay back, as if you may get killed if you get dropped back to 0 again. Bigger feeling of danger and deadlines. \nIt really is a matter of preference here. I've never found the PF2 system overly complicated, but that's just me. \n\nActions: I don't mind the 5E system. But PF2s just blows it out of the water. Love it. \n\nProficiencies: Love the TEML system. Couldn't agree more. I love that it's consistent on all aspects of the game, be it Skills, weapon proficiencies, armor, spell saying, etc. \n\nLayout of Books: I don't know enough of the 5E one. \nI also don't use the physical books very much. I usually use pf2.easytool.es or Nethys. But I've heard the book layout is awful. \n\nAdvantage/Disadvantage vs Number crunching: I like the simplicity of 5E for more pick up games, but I prefer the PF2 system. But it is hard to keep track of if you're not using some sort of software. \nIf you're playing straight up pen and paper I think D&D has the advantage on this aspect. But the PF2 one is actually not THAT complicated if you're well prepared. \n\nCharacter design: nothing to add here. \n\nFeats: I love feats in PF2. I love that they separate them in class/skill/general. I hate in 5E that you have to choose whether you need to give up Ability scores increases to get a feat. \nThe one thing I dislike about PF2 is that every time you get to choose a new feat, you also get new options. So if you really liked two level 2 feats and you want both, you're gonna have to sacrifice a higher level feat slot to get them both. I would prefer more chances to pick up lower level feats. \nThe free archetype and Ancestral Paragon Variant rules help with this though. \n\nSkills: My GM hates PF2 feats because he's under the impression that you can't attempt stuff unless you have the feat for it. But that's just not true. The feat skills just let you know for sure what you're able to do. \nI don't remember much about 5Es system. But from what I recall I could almost attempt anything and it was completely up to the GM what he did or didn't allow and I don't necessarily like not having at least a bit of structure. \n\nSpells: Not many spells in PF2 have the option of spending 1-3 actions. Which is unfortunate because it's a fantastic system. \nApparently we're getting alot more in Secrets of Magic in a few months. \nI do like that prepared casters in 5E have a bit more freedom on what they can cast. But apparently that will also be an archetype released in secrets of Magic. \n\nMagic items. Nothing to add.\n\nCritical system: I'm playing Solasta right now which is based off of 5E and omg, I miss the PF2 Crit system so much. \n\nMulticlassing: I always hated giving up a class levels to get other level stuff, and because of it I never wanted to multiclass. The PF2 system is very fair, flavorful and balanced. Love it. \nAnd there's also archetype dedications. Magnificent."", 'I have to disagree with the wounded/dying vs. deathsaves point. Wounded/dying actually has repercussions to going to 0 multiple times.
